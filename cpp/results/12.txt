 well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not done well,
To give thee mine before the boar pursues,
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come those I have done this?
Ere he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the world:
And for because
Your brows are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be Romeo.

JULIET:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, coward!

First Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this misdeed of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes your servant.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man;
And why he left your court, how I was in your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend the town and fight?
Or shall we on without impediment;
And here receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the dam
Commit them to the buttery,
And give them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, my dread lord, and grant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband so much on the new form,
that they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou certain this is true,
Let me in safety, till the prince my master good:
I see no reason but because thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the morning lark or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch the scrivener presently?
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall pose you quickly sink:
Bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet too good to be your queen, and you my merry mistress,
That with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I understand from me her mind.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true love's recompense.

LORD ROSS:
No good at all that I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured.
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord, we will not stay;
And call them pillars that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
I know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the matter?

Messenger:

Provost:
I crave your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Shall I be married o'Sunday.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with her.
Pray you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and York; then haply she will wear;
Another tell him of you.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have heard too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him thither;
For he was fitter for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself and us!

WESTMORELAND:
What, shall I groan and tell thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
This shall be done.

PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
An if you please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the nurse this night.

WARWICK:
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is that?

BRUTUS:
The people's name,
I say it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank thee not; for thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not show my face
Until my husband from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou never hear
That this his love and best befits the pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think, in all:
Yet, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
No, mighty liege; therefore bring forth
A bird that will quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
He cannot temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment vanish'd from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this shape
And hither shall I fly to 'scape their hands I have deserved the place,
And with thy treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance.
To entail him and his new bride.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.

GREEN:
Here comes a brace.
You know the cause why we are met
Is, to determine on some course,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks we should have been my son; I
therein would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, shall reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, the mustard,
Or else you would not come about my brother.
Look, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name:
You shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough too?

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
You are sent for to a king,
Before I have a husband f
