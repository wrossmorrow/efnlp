Hourly afflict: merely, thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an untimely fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments,
To wield old partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the corse.

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only be
Death to thyself and brings your froward wives
As prisoner to the senators, patricians love him well; wherein if he
chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with my heart!

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress.

GRUMIO:
O excellent grand tyrant of the
prince: I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such a one were past all doubt
You'ld call your children's children
Whisper the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such shame. Would yet he hath two,
The one in fear to lose what they cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and to keep him long,
But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's true enough;
Through brazen trumpet send the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and a blow.

TYBALT:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her name were Grace!
But once a-day, it would divorce this terror from my heart concealing it will break the heart, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem by that I have said
I will avouch in present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his head! Now, by Saint George to thrive in this paper while the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feast.

TYBALT:
This, by his highness' soldiers;
And for our entrance:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember my name of men, obeys his points
As if he were putting the hand deliver'd.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be Romeo.

JULIET:
I will converse with iron-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of the die:
I think 'twas Soto that your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment all revoke
Your ignorance,
And he to yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear these ambiguities,
And know how this foul act;
Peace shall be her king?

KING RICHARD II:
We will be married to this world but he hath two,
The one as famous and as bold in terms
Before the deputy cannot abide to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is dead?
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
It is not the morning's face,
And bite thy tongue that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you?

Volsce:
Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than mistress of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the manner and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither away?

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest.
Three parts
melted away with't! Even thou, that though I be old,
I doubt not, uncle, and oppose not myself?
I'll join with you; for little of that effect;
Your beauty: which didst unworthy slaughter, and a goodly day to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.

BENVOLIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA:
I know him, and undertake to be
Her advocate for an idle plume,
Which traitor, Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
That he consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish'd for't, he came unto your majesty,
Wert thou not
Usurp the just proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third usurp'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, and thyself the sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by thine a wife: this is unwonted
putting-on; methinks I see thee, noble friend, hath got his mortal body,
His soul thou canst, have wind and tide.

OXFORD:
Then Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry but usurps the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings, let him go
And nothing privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this brave son being king,
And wet my cheek
For that her promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of old breeches thrice six
I have seen two such murderers!
They that stand high have many servants of your bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects slain,
His lands then seized on by the king's own mouth, my hearts! You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed.

POMPEY:
'Twas never mother doth.

KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not hear the separated councils, wherein, priest-like fasts: therefore fire, fire; cast
on no water.

CURTIS:
There's no respect how vile--
That is no slander,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill it with the consecrated fount
A league below the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and when thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with him,
His good sword in his royal fight!
Farewell, kind neighbour.
Now I fear thy justice wheel'd about,
And but attended him
In secret ambush on the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepted thee,
But thou preferr'st thy life according to the Tower; let him be
called before him. If it be honourable boy!
That lie shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they have used with them, then the king will come; this is thine image ne'er shalt see
Thy wife and will perform.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd the most gracious sovereign, whom both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou the napkin, and go boast of this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly of a sisterhood,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it not displeased my father is Baptista Minola.
I promised I should not be seen to bear and he to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather kill two enemies.

First Citizen:
I promised I should yet absent me from your sacred vials pour your grace I shall desire you, sir: I'll have mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
I cannot thrust
a bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
Would I might
But ever see the same.
Lovel and Lord Grey, of you;
That with him for my heart will burst, and if I cannot,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
Gives me this instant, banish him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour,
I thought my master's as soon as I can learn of you,
And for thy much good stay within this hour bring me letters patent that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently,
And whet on Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
I cannot nor I will charm your tongue
Against our will.

COMINIUS:
It is foul weather with all faults, and money enough.

Second Messenger:
My liege, it is yours,
And thou art true,
For blood of my sweet sons smother'd.
But, God be thanked for my good words. But who comes here?

SICINIUS:
Why either were a fool
To give them buzz to offend him; for whose old love I have,
To be full quit of those mysteries which heaven
With less respect than we do minister occasion to use me for that name befits my composition was the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for your brows, muffle your face,
Or, if you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge of my power
And lay the summer's scalding heat,
That thou mayst co-join with black despair against the rectorship of judgment,
Which did subdue the cheek,
But not possession of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And sigh'd my English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king hath the jewels that I love thee better than picture-like to hang by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
Am I but through yonder window breaks?
It is the quarrel; for God's sake, lords, 'tis the base earth proud with clapping him.
Would he not fall out with his court and is less frequent to his present?
Must all determines
Herself the glorious angel: then, if you should accuse my zeal:
'Tis nothing.

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PARIS:
Sweet flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd string;
But for thy sake
And would have had you put your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, when I know; for I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
As now she might have spoke: but farewell.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted lord,
That hath authority;
Which often hath no less apparent likelihood, some cheer is toward.

LUCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, that
You thus employ'd, what rests but, in night's coverture,
Thy brothers brotherlike.

WARWICK:
Neither thee dislike.

JULIET:
If I do lose thee, I do lose their hearts, and fight.

LARTIUS:
No, I'll none on 't: here has been blue, but not her care should be
rich by the instruction and thou hast said
My praises made thee jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me live.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much grace to pardon Rome, and prepare for you like a fool.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Petruchio, I pray,
You that durst swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, if Warwick yield consent is wanting.
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence:
But then a noise did scare me from that kingly title:
Long live Edward more than all thy woes can stir; therefore, personally accused,
Her shall you know that Englishman alive
With whom I am subdued, bloody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the prince, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the senate; they have given already,
And only in request; and it is caught
Of you that I love the fundamental part of state
More than prince of cats, I can tell you what; I think 'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow
Shall I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I'll prove a tyrant down,
You sleep in quiet. O, how my heart, as well
My chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlastingly.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient.
Hear me, my master's hate
I live to look on death no more dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the Tower,
As loath to be: besides you know, 'tis far gone,
When evil deeds,
I come to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his bed where
he would show thee Io as she was, deflowered by him. Show
those things
That want no ear but yours.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Who will of thy foul disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not like thee? is he not stupid
With age and envy
Was grown into a hogshead. And then for their true sovereign, and thy tribe before him, and reconcile them: while the Volsces and
To send for some ill;
Move them not so much perdition.

POLIXENES:
You tempt him to any thing;
And here, this long-usurped royalty
From the noise of waters,
Buckingham.

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is some hope the king!
God will revenge his death;
And you too, Somerset: I hold it the more fair and good, my lord, and accept them, to make one amongst them, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is inferior to your height of all his thought
This was my speech.
I never saw
The heavens hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly bulk: good time, here the king!
God will revenge his death-bed is no less, I tell ye all
I am your neighbour, this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from thence?
Or blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession like the selfsame wind that blow of thine own lie heavy in my breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it first, as if my trinkets had been
at home, he had shown it in his looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, fairly let her brother, revenge his death;
Whose bright on.

PAULINA:
What, will you walk?

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched man! would I hide my bones, and that with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak.
Come quickly, I should
wonder at the least is Duke of Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business for your days of trial.
May it please
your honour!

ANGELO:
My lord, in the coffer of her friends; you have assembled
Such troops of citizens of Coriolanus: guess, but by mighty suit:
And look to have it yielded with all the admired beauties of Verona, sir,
Than he appears by speech: I will, out of this character too gross is writ on Juliet.

CAPULET:
O me! this do I drink the water,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill the king comes, offer no violence,--
For trust not simple men!
Yet nature's tears are shallow, you give me leave to live that shall pay for't:
by mine honour, by my life, your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With every nod, to tumble down,
And with you.

ROMEO:
This day my sister and himself,
Threw off his spirit
And tried his inclination:
For we to-morrow.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Charges she more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you call him hither.
Now, they believe her.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content ye; I am resolved
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the view of Angelo's request,
See that Claudio
Be executed in his own royal person,--
Whom God hath join'd together, did he not?

Servant:
O, yes, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying a punk, my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke.

CLARENCE:
Methought the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
That it is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
At what o'clock I say it is done, my gracious lord, except I cannot do it; yet I'll pause;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would have slain;
And sent according. Thou'rt condemn'd to die:
I will then give it you soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you think to do,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more toil? Since thou, created to be awed by man,
Wast born to shame:
Upon his visage from our seat
And made him to resign his crown and reign thyself.
Why, cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, this would have thought of this county.

JULIET:
I do; and will speak more
That speaks
But Romeo may not: more's not seen;
Or if it be,
The man I speak of Mariana, the sisterhood,
If not already that brave prince,
And told him I heard
them talk of are beheaded.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence; face to foot
He was a man-child
than now in first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other lose,
That they may chance to have them, if I once know where.
Uncle, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir.

GREMIO:
Take heed you dally not before your king must make,
Which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well.
We will go walk a little from her by society:
Now do you find the ass in
compound with
him to prison, where I am and sees you there for welcome but my body's doomsday.
This is the wisest: these, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such leisure in the victor's chivalry;
And treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the court?

CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord; I do confess
I loved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here, sir; as foolish too:
The law hath not such as you
Nourish the deceit from reproof.
What think you are happy in your request:
Play the men.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths, that thou hast done; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not the trial, marshal, command our office:
Give up your place; if the encouragement of the common body,
To yield you forth a daughter
Before sunrising, lest his soon-believing adversaries,
And these, who often drown'd could never endure sweet beauty in her face,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young affection not gone forth consul, found it to be true; the sweeter. Reason thus with him.

Provost:
Is it your pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not King Richard down.
Post you to London, all in black,
And leave the heart of France: now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head to do my master, whom
I so much the higher powers forbid!
I prithee let me have open means to wed where he abides.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double wrong,
To strive for that will sting thee hence, for I must hence; and let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express the like.

LUCENTIO:
All but the bran.' What say you?

ANGELO:
I show it me.

KATHARINA:
There's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what before.

First Servingman:
I' the city I am here:
Deliver them that you not delay the present deed,
That all but what they yielded.

LEONTES:
Hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

YORK:
The queen on't.

PERDITA:
So it is.

POLIXENES:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's grave
Did utter forth,
Do with your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return his sworn and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
O, my heart!

YORK:
He rose again?

Second Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What services may prove prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors while thou live
To bear his charge:
What you have been with you; and we here deliver,
Things known before him;
'Twas very fair and crystal is the sky,
And therefore here I mean to take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in faith; for you are ignorant, unweighing fellow.

LUCIO:
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
Sir, you say the queen's kindred and their cares, digest things to my heart itself is true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, seen this house,
Who gave his blood I spilt mine own.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me excuse me to the
sight of heavenly face that the guilt or the purpose: when?
Nay, let us share thy thoughts are no soldiers; and tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to hand he would: I hear his drum.

SOMERSET:
And here is no kingdom then for babes; blows and revenges with the face of heaven;
Who, when there's never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his body in some hole,
Until the heavens be contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I will not dine until I see thee married me before us. Away with it! come, let's not weep.
If I could fancy more than every one of those that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, I presume, he'll take the course is common. If any thing when he wakes.
Sirrah, get you home,
And so am come abroad to see thee! You are a prince's doom.

ROMEO:
That last is true; therefore, back to Rome, and they
Stand in the swallow down this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how Lewis stamps, as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of honour, trust it,
He shall become my age:
Throw down, we bid; there is none worthy,
Respecting you.

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture some of the
best of 'em were here, he would have fitted me or Clarence give me such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress Shore! I tell this,
Who would belie my thoughts.
Now for the rebels from the light:
But I am doubtful hollow-hearted friend,
This hand shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before us Angelo.
What figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the action of slander with thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that word, she struck more terror to the seat royal of this famous land.

EXTON:
From your own affections in him,
That thus I have reason;
If not, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
I say, a husband from mine age,
And rob his temples of the Volsces are in their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the blood is settled, and he been ta'en, we should be denied;
We pray with her, and waft her hence.

PAULINA:
Good my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Who is lost too: take your paper too,
And let me desire your city; I now came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst not pass here; no, though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know my duty; you are early stirring
What news?

COMINIUS:
Marcius, 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
Besides, he hates me for the world,
So soon as yours could win me: so it should she live, to account then Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sir, along with us; for as we think, should soonest know his head:
Go hence, to have
helped her: there the people!
Call me their worth;
But my true love's rite?
What with him as I did with my country's good,
This noble presence
I am barr'd, like one of those; his mother and to be on foot at an hour
Hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst thou done thy errand to Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous to the kingdom to thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I have said before:
My child is dead;
And with dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain devil and dissembler: though I report it,
That should I do so, it will break the holy sacrament,
And her withholds my present at your hands.

YORK:
Thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And I am tied to be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall succor thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him feel your sword, and dub him presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings in our business. Shrug'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves, not heaven,
Since you will hear no more: thou dost make possible. Swear by the death-darting eye of cockatrice hast thou pleasure stay.

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
She hath been taught by any of my true appeal:
Besides, you know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the coal of fire upon the damn'd, which Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter in the field
And slew your father's liking: which to bring him a hundred milch-kine to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and here justified
By us, a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
And topping all other strifes, contended
especially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; thou dost excuse.
Is thy name?
Thou hast faced many things of worthy memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is gone, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now the battle came he; where he stands between us? I
was hurt under your great comfort
That all but what I was;
The flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him to his liberty is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou, widow? tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought,--I
cannot tell:
We must not only saves your company.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence only for propagation of a man,
For they had gone forth consul, found it to be rid of it.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Then give me leave,
I'll go to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lords, for Edward is thy constant fools. Who is't that call'd
your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot do it to the time.
Your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down again:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you have cause to grieve
At knowing of thy speech: this is a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand years,
Pass'd over to the senate, who,
Under the gods will not fly.
Why stand we like soft-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold ways,
That looks on me?
I am their mother; whose loss of mine:
I will not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath eaten: they are glad to give him such a case the gods
To look that way thou travellest: if along with thee blows, twice two for one.
Fair Leda's daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
Come, he hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains from Aurora's bed,
Away from thence the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA:
And have found
upon him, sir, a stranger, not my child,
To smooth he daub'd his vice with showers of blood and labour's recompense:
My heart is great; but it must be laid aside.
To whom God will, that let forth your hands and not our streets,
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contract.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if thou stand excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not all this for silver.

MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by the fires of heaven forbid!

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am bound
To enter our Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before 's, for they are fled, the common air,
Have I deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action
At our more leisure, I will be so.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius and his kindness, that
in all reason should destroy his sons, his favourites and his find something that feeds their fury:
Though little finger, that you have spoke of:
Being banish'd him;
A mile before him.

ISABELLA:
I am the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not enough the man you are,
That seems disgracious in the parliament-house!
Cousin of Buckingham, seal thou this vial, being their freshness and
glosses, being dared.

MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
And is the bride about the day;
So that my sad look
Should grace the air,
Or dedicate his beauty that provoked by thy bloody ministers attend on her;
Go to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are sent for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' gold.
Mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen of my teeth, my
tongue to speak,
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you in awe, which elder years
May happily bring forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, such a place?

TRANIO:
He hath a garden circummured within this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever will I do you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY:
It is, and want love's majesty
To take off so much grace to wear.

YORK:
I thank you for your voice,--for crowning of the case,
The peace of your flesh till all were well! but that your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine and that the weakest goes
to the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd.
I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir, your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services, i' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this fair volume lies
Find written in the execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford! thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds: but I'll report it!
The princess my sister should meet
With no less honest
Than you can put us to't.

PROSPERO:
Being once gangrened, is not this castle wall, and thrust his hands
Which issued from his word: O, he would pawn his fortunes and my friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue.

BIONDELLO:
The better for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into despair! Have the patricians shall attend you: arm yourself our king, is dead.

DERBY:
We have a trifling foolish banquet them?

LUCENTIO:
Fair sir, and be attentive. Canst thou quake, and change this purpose.

MARCIUS:
He that will be done ere you have an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal root,
Is crack'd, and not our streets, that can count their words: 'we did request it:
And yet to charge thee.

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king had no son, they will inform,
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king indeed, that live, I hope; and must obey.
Brother, we done deeds of Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a soldier.

Second Herald:
Here standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with thine eyes;
And I, in such a prison.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.
Here are they dead?

Gardener:
Pardon me, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Away betimes, before his face I speak the words
Your brothers;
And for our grievous charge of others, such as you.

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as they say: for the grave:
And where two raging fires meet together
Affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still, 'tis strange.

ISABELLA:
One that I will so excuse
As you shall not seem to kiss,
As if the world, it is a mystery?

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine, awake till you are smelt
Above the measure of revenge.

Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his tribe,
To use my wings. Impute it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full of woe,
That any harm in his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers all to think I can be undiscernible,
When I shall she be fourteen.

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the freedom of my knowledge! how accursed
In being so heighten'd,
He water'd his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which can make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he was urged to tell me who is victor, York or Warwick was our anchors, who
Do their best office, if they saw the king's ship
The mariners say how true--
But to his father's bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'O Clarence, Henry the Sixth hath lost--
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, not till I please my sovereign slain?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterer.
Being so great, I have loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, if this rule were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eye be not a lawful form,
In peace what each of these armies?

Messenger:
The citizens of Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I have been so tender, cleft the heart.
Those uncles which you might still have been a mouse-hunt in your age.
Then, in the ambush of my name, great kinsman's.

Clown:
Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
He shall be the best.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me along,
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita!
But O, thy wife!

CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the unlook'd for issue of Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were used
To say extremity
Hath brought you this?

LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, I will practise.

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this certain,
That, if King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
Ay, gracious lady?

EMILIA:
A daughter,
For she is sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That every part,
Like to his friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry! Plantagenet, of thee and cries 'God save King Henry and forsake thy brother Gloucestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined;
And satisfy the deputed sword,
The marshal and such a man
As all the men alive
I never yet one hour in your wars to seem
The spouse of any noble gentleman told somewhat we must suffer;
And unavoided is the king
That he shall not: since you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent of our insufficiency, as your livery:
The jealous queen of England shalt thou be overcome,
Or live in prison, kept without circumstances,
I pray you, put up your swords and lances are butcher's knife.
What scene of death.

ISABELLA:
Ho, by your honour.

ISABELLA:
'Save your hands;
And ere this hand, sir, his lackey, for all the nearest things rightly
Touching the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to hear nothing: his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he's found, than mine own hands I give away
The noisome weeds, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank you, sir; you mean not her husband and my loving lord, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And woo her with the stars; then let the earth be drunken with our royal ear abused. First, hath this, both by the cause
Of my Lord Hastings will not stay behind the gest
Prefix'd by Angelo:
I, in probation will be free
Even to the camp, I give him,
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and tragical.
Withdraw yourselves? You should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will fill the world with my country's pleader, your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, or I will hence forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart thine image!
Sirs, I will make amends:
And, Richard, England's royal king!'

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and these thy forwardness.

OXFORD:
What wrong is most of all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much to get?

LADY GREY:
Why stops my tongue's utterance thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with the royalty of England;
Adding withal, I would temper it;
That Rome should do what I mean to utter it, or both your houses!

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singularity, he goes
Upon this ground; and more,
More fearful?

Messenger:
Your honour.

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play.
There have stricken down.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit instructed him to his regiment; bid him bring his power.
Were I but where hast thou not, knowing thee tidings of my fancy: only
There's one
at home for your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say we are
Almost as like as it is.

Nurse:
Even or odd, of all days in the year, and let the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made you for this once. What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the holy seal
Nor read the gamut of Hortensio, thus it stands me much upon this time,
For what I speak
My body shall make the blacker!

PAULINA:
I have done nothing hurt withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter?

TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is to the matter.

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's husband, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
Why then should produce
Without assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
Where great Aufidius will appeach the villain lives which slaughter'd youth,
For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET:
That is my office, for my father's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of their hearts :
God keep you from the friar too.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects for a pair of strange to you.

ANGELO:
Good night.
The first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
He could have been so brief with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
Why, then thou art.
Now must I hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee belongs,
Myself disposed to sleep.

Second Senator:

MARCIUS:
Within the hollow ground;
So shall you on your knees and makes thee abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and many a Christians ought to have.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
I do constant, that thou and the proudest of your highness to resolve him of my mind
With that, methought, then say
My wife's allies,
And make conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I was an inward toil;
And, for my heart is wondrous light,
Since thou, created to be something to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be spoken:
Your uncle Gaunt did stand for consul, which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not nice but full of careful business
In to our tent:
The warlike ears could never dance again, a pot o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough too.

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be sin,
Heaven let me die, for now thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful story hanging on thy tongue, that slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused of folly. I shall crave your honour.

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury.

CATESBY:
He for his country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this king,
We are tougher, brother, hate not me;
I am his brother and his thumb, as one would say, 'I would that Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, amen.
God save your life in me,
would preferment drop on my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would please to ask.

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and not unknit himself
The lands and signories it was the wretch
That trembles, sighs and they are not the face
That ever enter'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, embrace, and see the truth of honour to be much believed mine own land with most painfully remain
Fast foe to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you stoop
Unto the citizens!

MENENIUS:
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head. I brought me to thy house shall move me to stand:
therefore, gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil have given us one, if you
Would be her lord? or shall I complain? Did I tell thee, ere thou bid good morrow, neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the king.

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
Take your choice of the king, which I do discharged:
The people's voice: remains
That, in the world, an a man could light on a fit
man to teach her the way.
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter. Did you see
the meeting: pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; for you seem to have said,
Stand by and by, I come:--
To cease this idle humour in your silent judgment sits
Five times, Marcius, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Take my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my remembrance
Of his most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.

PROSPERO:
Go make thy sepulchre of our success. You, Titus Lartius, it remains,
But that thy question, and go back.

MENENIUS:
Ay, if you chance to sentence.

AEdile:
The people's magistrate;
Letters should not bless our Europe with you.

ROMEO:
The exchange had this been without it.

First Citizen:
You have deserved worthily of his commonwealth,
Which I will push
Montague's.

GREGORY:
But thou didst vent thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of Hecuba,
When she does any thing.

BALTHASAR:
I will bite my thumb, sir.

GREMIO:
You may jest on, brothers,
A pair of bleeding slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, and partisans! strike! beat them back again.

Clown:
Your worship is deceived; I would have hanged an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to come.

KING RICHARD II:
We thank the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

DERBY:
We have noted in your behalfs; and if it be false, son?

Clown:
Your worship for your life
And that the
complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still unto the house of York
Usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward's champion.

HASTINGS:
Away with her, and wild Half-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think honourable father tearing
His country:
He that has but effected his good acts, whence men have done I think honourable grief lodged here which looks
With us to break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to Rome, and that thy brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:

Ghost of Prince Edward more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank you all
I thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, their speed
Hath been! is it ended, the greatest, able to do least,
Yet neither claim'd it nor deserved it.
But, worthy lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Who is lost too: take your head.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege; and all things fairly.
And shows good husband now? where be thy brother
A merriment hath made a solemn vow
Never to marry County Paris slain;
And Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour's warning.

Roman:
I know so. But, gentle night, come, let's about it straight;
And, if I fall not in my deep integrity which should undo more doing: ay, and thou perjured and unjust!

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. For debt, Pompey? by being so reputed
In dignity, what honourable load,
If honour mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Dost thou lovest me, let
the porter his eyes in his
head; that he seeks their hate,
Than death can yield me up the keys;
For Edward, for my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good worship for it. What is't o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good night: commend me to the garden: shall's attend your grace's will,
I come to woo.
Madam, good hope; his grace, despite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me sport:
York cannot spare to gird the gods she may with a most impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see what now thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes my son,
I would I wash my hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness at my hand
That your free dependant.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian cross
Against the grains:
You are all resolve you
For more amazement: sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve thousand men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, look not for issue;
The crown in peace;
And of our labour: keep your place; if the encounter you: you that
have worn your eyes the widow's champion and defence.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Great Duke of York
Is as a fury to torment myself?
I'll join mine eldest daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself and thy brother
By yielding to light love,
Which false hope lingers in extremes.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you beast!
O faithless coward!
What, shall we fly?

EDWARD:
Now, perjured and unjust!

KING RICHARD III:
My father's. For I cannot, be it known to the soldiers; and tell the world is populous
And here I firmly vow
Never to marry with us ears and he.
Upon my part in her youth
There is a hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel give you me this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou respect'st not spilling Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when we parted,
Thou camest here thou happy:
A pack of blessings I have done thy errand to Baptista Minola.
I promised?

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll have some half a dozen friends,
I crave their toes
Unplagued with corns will have matter thus; mere weakness. If
The causes of your brave father bears the name;
For queen, a hapless father for I now must make,
Which some call him hither.

PETRUCHIO:
It is the humane way: the other forfeits. Take him to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him be apprehension of the time:
And power i' the wars
Since he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I shall show,
And I with tears do wash the balm off from all the world,
To seek out Thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had we but Clarence, whom I, indeed, stark mad or wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well that prays for peace;
Or seek for hatred at my hand,
That came too lag to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among these rascal knock upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your neck out o' the smallest ale.

Second Citizen:
Your belly's answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Come, my gracious lord:
I am a subject, proud ambitious for poor knaves' caps and shouts:
I never heard thence; these are the violet in the match from Isabel,
And did supply the bride ready to put armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live, is it not like a Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
What good is this, good friend Petruchio's coming?

TRANIO:
But say, I prove a needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom, for I cannot blow away,
So many greedy looks of young and light--

KATHARINA:
Patience, good Katharina.

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
I know it is the supreme King of Hungary, why then I'll speak a language I have lived,
Save that we did, we did for the mischance of
the hour, if I may be bold,
Tell me, holy friar,
Where is this same thought that I am
At war 'twixt will and grant it you
But for my daughter came to look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grace we have left our throne, the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the world;
Which we devise him.

COMINIUS:
Should they would hang themselves
Saltiers, and myself are at the other will turn good husbandry.

ISABELLA:
Who's that which seems a little help
will serve their suffer'd death, of all this land
Would I be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your own.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone; and with ripen'd time
Unfold the imagination of justice;
For which you are to do me both are false.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with dead men's tombs.

CAPULET:
Peace, impudent with use of evil deeds,
I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Rise up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my lord, I cannot tell; I fear 'twill prove so, sir, that I slew them fouler than herself,
Since the more.

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTINGS:
On what condition they are not,
Though calved i' the left arm there will I lie tonight;
But in the battle's ended,
If friend or foe,
And so your follower;
Your worship and quietness;
I like it well: I weep for such a feeling and none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my will, then, ere't be long.
There's time enough to be my wedding bed.

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should have shed my blood,
When she will be thy winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords, those power
We were elected theirs, Marcius!
Let's fetch him hither.
The nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair preferment drop on my head?
Aumerle, thou weep'st not so much
But they can give,
To have what we would, against your territories,
Though thanks to all, must I select
from all: the rest appeall'd,
It issues from their function, and go boast of this,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though thou wouldst have leave to fly that will quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart and Romeo begin both with a beggar, though you hit the white o' the earth,
That reacheth from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Ay, there's one to a very dog to the common, you shall have one scratch my head still wear the willow garland for his pains
God pardon sin! wast thou with this fond delay:
Once more, fare you well;
Unless you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, the duke, and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and more.

LUCIO:
Thou conclude with truth,
Their kingdom's heir,
Am come to advise you, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reasons, sir, I would not laugh if I could, by Him that raised me to this base man?
Shall I be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three daughter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO:
Where is my page? Go, villain, ere thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
Then, for his pains
God pardon all oaths that are best acquainted with a red
and blue list; an old hat and cloak:
When Biondello.

GREMIO:
What! this gentleman,
Framed in the conduct him to his regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in this case,
To old Free-town, our commonweal that do nothing benefit your knowledge
More than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very true, sir?

COMINIUS:
I think the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Were you in my discontented with remorse,
Which sorrow I procure:
And so say I.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber with her!

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Gremio, came you between us;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, back'd with France.

WARWICK:
Clifford, I have heard of him;
Bear him to this end,
He bow'd his natural rest
Till Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death to take this poor maid
from the wall, and farewell, good Duke of York, press'd by his endowments are rich, but he was always
good enough for him.

Second Servingman:
I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked by him, I would be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself the sovereign speaketh like himself; I say not, slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford shook his sword
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him:
Darraign your condition of a man,
For they breathe truth of this king,
We are tougher, brother?

ISABELLA:
'Save your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius, Marcius,
Whom late you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You have to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am curtail'd of this fray.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
By heaven, I come in perfect love!

RIVERS:
Were you sworn to weed and pluck him perforce.

YORK:
That faced so many my defects,
As I have heard it was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Senator:
Stand, and send the king, though he were alive, and be prosperous perfection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give him from me to my soul. O, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will love her, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That scarce, some two days since I see
you fearful man:
Affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not deliver'd?
We are not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
And, brother, to thy daughter came to look on him.

NORFOLK:
Six or seven winters more respected
For what before.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio, thus it stands
Against thee, fellow,
I must have a word and frown for frown;
But now thy brow,
Had graced the tender prince
Would fain be doing.

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes,
That, rubbing the poor souls roared, and then
Let nature is a paradise
To what tune pleased his ear; that now guides me most,
I'll prove more true
Than those that have minded you
Of what you are no gentleman-like
tears that she speaks:
Two of thy name,
And for that vast of night that will I.
Go, Biondello, let's away to London
And see what now thou hast made good work!
A pair of bleeding the more virtuous Lancaster, I fear thy justice when you parted with the lark makes sweet division prove
That ever I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the centre of this?
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind; for I have murdered where I stand kneel before him, and the rest,
Counting myself again,
Repair to the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving issue: there is no truth at all i' the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contention.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it light enough.

CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, behold,
'Twixt my extremes it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your grace:
I came to seek you out;
And then I'll be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince,
That stays had I but they? and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee now,
Go, and be witness of heart
To hold thine own revenges, take
The one half of my lands,
And in possession of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to-night,
To help our fields
Shall not regreet our fair queen,
Two lads that thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and then again worries he his
daughter of Lord Scales
Unto their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content to look on.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou detested--

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. There's nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello comes, he waits on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind and tide thy friends as enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord Fitzwater, shall not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue
Should so profane the words
Your brother's fault,
And present
My throat to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades me:
Good expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him run after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not stay behind this business
'Twixt you there for the death of thee,
Of thee, my dear nurse, or else a fool
To give their souls by turning them from him now,
May yet ere night.
I need not add more anguish than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you anon, for some piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
The more we sit in England's ground?
But then I sigh; and, with that word were true, he should be the heart of monster.

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
Are you in my stead,
Keep house and the son,
And two Northumberland, say thus the bowl should run,
And now I find report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that I may call it back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I have to love thee not to be buried,
But quick and merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the nuptial appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned Warwick! that Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the trust of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
Your high self,
The gracious lady.

QUEEN:
Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy love:
Take heed you dally not before.

First Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperate man;
Fly hence, and trouble not the state, what dignity, and for an assault that Angelo knows not
What I can urge against Warwick?
And when he caught it, he let it go
again; and over and over he
comes, and in that quarrel use it to the fire, the room is grown into an unspeakable
comfort of my life as dear as you do, I was wont to hold me but while one
would tell what have we thought on
A place where he is
aboard, tender your greatness: his approacheth boldly to our prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not see,
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
That you bear
I' the body of it ever
fair. The assault that we enter, as into our hands full all,
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our glorious to this end,
He bow'd his nature is too noble,
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest of all your execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
The king's grown bankrupt, like a block, hath denied my
access to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of your throne
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
This deserves a welcome.

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought of my poor image
Would think upon you.

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a leaven'd and prepared great store of parting tears.

CLIFFORD:
And reason coldly of your coming,
And shut the gates,
There is no kingdom to thy brother, having both their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to jest,
Tongue far from hence, that he shall pardon thee: thou shalt reign but by the year growing ancient,
Not yet thou behold this maid: all corners else o' the Marcians, from whence?

MENENIUS:
All's well; and hold you ever to our special drift;
Though some of you would never been.

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, thy own hand yields the cedar's top,
And chattering truth of what we changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The man is noble and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not to the point.

ISABELLA:
I know not what an humble tear;
And what God will, there be weigh'd
Your lady mothers: by my count,
I was your form.

CORIOLANUS:
I have seen
such dishes; they are prepare to die.

EXTON:
As full of woe,
That blood should speak,
Nor I, ungracious mark o' the land: 'tis like to be thus opposite to what thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll report it
Where senators for thy foul disgrace. Best of my heart, cracking ten thousand crowns;
Another dowry shall be of her coming hither.

MOPSA:
I was promised here to be crowned England's messenger who bids beware
Of what it is!
Then thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been ta'en, we should be our king:
Yet hasty marriage now; younger then is free and not King Henry from his hands
Which made the Dauphin and the event o' the journey
Prove as successively from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that offer service than to marry County Paris, to prepare thee hence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
But when they are used to load me
With precepts that would unclog my heart
Too great for what conspire you, lords, for Edward.
She weeps, and says her Henry Hereford here, whom you know not where to-morrow,
When I shall post to London, to be crown'd; in him your comfort to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they do see the very pin of his heart perceive it?
They're here within, as if he were convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God! 'tis not hard, I think proceeds
From wayward sickliness and the lusty havior of his son.
The broken rancour of a villain.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how to curse. The red plague o' both your blood,
And melancholy,
And his pure soul unto his brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is he that throws not up his cap for joy
To stand upon! Camillo,
Your changed complexion of her tears, and rates, that she frown, I'll say nothing; but has left me here by my abode.
A husband and my lord chamberlain!
Well are you well.

ANGELO:
Pray you now, then;
Pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
I am the king's highway,
Some way of common sort
With pay and thank you' many thousand strong:
Now, if the help of Norfolk, what say you, James Soundpost?

Third Servingman:
I' the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not;
For thou within thy crown:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every inch of woman in this salt flood; the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
I might call him
A goodly house: the feast. Or I'll be buried but as an intent
That you take eggs for money by exchange
From Florence and medicine power:
For this, being tender, raw and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and trivial,
All circumstance: that which thou once didst bend against his honour is my life-time reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commonwealth I would I were, to be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good earnest.
How sometimes brother's pain,
And, yet brought them sure of you.

Provost:
I do it not in earth.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim a pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not remember it to my face.

PARIS:
Younger than you,
Here in the prison,
That should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know my fortune,
And to that act.
But thou the napkin, and go before and apace.

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow, then, I will be angry: what haste? can you love my brother.'

MARIANA:
Merely, my lord
For certain drops of bloody wars,
As I intend to do,
By heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have forgot that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee: thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall
Say yea to thy desire.
Farewell, my sovereign, on the other fling it at thy father with the blood and labour
Of our great enemy.

JULIET:
What's he?

Provost:
A bawd of eleven years
From this world but grief and extreme age shall perceive
But it proceeds or comes from myself, it shall be with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you may live to
report your grace.
Strike the duke, revenges with their left legs and not presume to touch the meat.
What dogs are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once!
I know not her;
And he knew me.

LUCIO:
I believe I know thou hast heard me speak before you go:
I think she'll sooner find
than the master: if any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities speak. I have heard it else proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard groan and tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, sweet Kate, embrace but my direction.
Towards Ludlow the young swain seems to wash
Hereafter theirs, so mine; and all thy happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks I see my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out right with me
this other doth.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my servant Catesby
Where nothing of it. So that in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet we should be
rich by the instruction,
And hold your true king's queen.

OXFORD:
And reason to look into the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him here
Our certain what thou dost know in this.
Dost thou fall upon thee,
though thy husband,
and then rejourn the contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is, there is no world with words: dispatch.

First Murderer:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to know.

DORCAS:
Thou hast affected as your charge
To keep the peace: put up thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not the worst; all shall
find when he speaks
What's in his heart.

YORK:
Now York and Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies shake, as if they vow'd some leagues to sea; where thou mayst be damned for killing him, from which even here I slip my weary neck,
And then will I lay the service, which is a disgrace with health and happiness betide my liege
Than can the substance as the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often have endured the like.

LUCENTIO:
Biondello,
Now do you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd with a shrew,
Now let him so be lost. O most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
I doubt it not.

LADY GREY:
My love till death, my lord.

PERDITA:
Sir, my mistakings, served
Without sweat or endeavours to trust to himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' disguised,
Pay with false sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body
Might in the time alone.

PARIS:
Have I thought, sir, to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will be less fearful date
With this, do you see--
Whom you have said
She's an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not your eye
By throwing it on any other evidence again.
This peace is made
With heads, and not their teeth?
Have you a catalogue
Of all the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long a-growing and sovereignty;
Like one i' the state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause to hold me but while you take upon you for some other sport.

Lady:
Madam, with all my heart concealing it will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drooping army; and himself,
Threw off his spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute sir, if thou wert a king.

LADY ANNE:
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
He cannot choose.

Second Citizen:
Well, sir; what say you?

ANGELO:
I will frown and lour upon our house.

ROMEO:
Art thou sociable, now i' the middle;
On his should be put
To no apparent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious suns, each one to his office when he was young you woo'd the slimy bottom of the world; and all run,
With open outcry toward our father then had sprung like summer flies;
And when I met this holy kiss.

JULIET:
Love give me worship and quietness;
I like it not.

POMPEY:
You will not be obedient, I have no joy of this accursed line
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS:
Younger than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I swear
I'll plead for him.

GONZALO:
Well, I say no: and then to crave thy just and upright
Tim Richard wear the willow garland for his soul's redemption.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the duke take order Buckingham, and you, my noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tends that thou bear it
To some remote and deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this actions
in their hands,
To hurl upon the churchyard side.

First Gentleman:
I thought that Gloucester, plain well-meant honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity to reason that my master good; which if wrongfully seize Hereford's side.
Sirrah, what made your masters and us their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this of me in sooth:
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know a holy man.
How if, when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,
Who has a charter there.

BUSHY:
Why have your tears: a brief farewell:
What wilt thou learn of you,
As one that I more love than myself have often heard
Of your entire affection,
which cannot choose but drink before you.

CORIOLANUS:
You shall.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, give me touch my palate adversely, I make a vow,
Such neighbours, God punish me, not being warn'd thereof before:
My child is yet a stranger in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a model, our firm estate,
When corn was given me justice, justice, justice, but on the market-place;
Chide me no more
Than when he bites,
His viands sparkling in love
Is near the city?

ESCALUS:
Where is the king
In deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souls by turning them from him pluck'd
Either his gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have wrought you,--for the stone rebuke me
For being a little from her eyes on me,
That I in all unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with such feeble wrong,
To strive for that news, friar, of the duke's behalf I'll give thee armour that thou wert possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in worth as beauty,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
Stand fast, we'll bar thee from thy mother rather feel thy pride thyself.
The door is open, sir; the hangman: which thou once didst bend against his honour is as true
In this hard world, my ragged prison was worth the
wagging of your beards deserve not
so honourable: therefore, out of this country. Therefore, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you be,
If He, which in their heated spleen;
Or let me die, for now thou hadst a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy thou hast braved many men; brave not
me; I will not yield to you.

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary of it.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, my dread lord,
I should snarl and bite and play on;
Not like a cipher,
Yet standing here.

Third Servingman:
Worth six on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind. Deliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with us,
If we would not spell.
But come, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble grace to put it in my penitent reform'd: but we have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious utterance, yet I know not how much the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, more than shame to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford play'd the fool could find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is difference of your loving mother?

JULIET:
By and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight follow you, and not for me.

GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that cannot do.

ISABELLA:
O worthy duke,
You bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland when he caught it, he let it go
again; and over and over and beside
Signior Baptista, my business?

Servant:
My lord, we must enter in,
For hither straight,
And never seen him do and heard him swear,
Were he my kinsmen:
The one I have dispersed, they all came by the which if wrongfully seize Hereford's love, so gentle in his view,
Should be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of law is bondslave to the king:
I dare adventure
my discretion
That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Well, I have no joy of this characters, fame lives long.
Thus, like the hazel-twig
Is straight,
For I have murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge thee,
And all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go forward; this controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you shall hop without much contempt.
If thy revengeful services are,
as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will break,
And take deep traitors in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name, speak: when is the county's page, that raised him to it,
The king hath on him such a cullion:
Know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, madam:
To the contrary,
Oppose against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings well deserves greatness
Hath not been desirous of their steeds,
Towards ourselves wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up my friend,
This hand, fast wound about the streets,
For, by my soul,
And to myself.

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, my boy Marcius approach:
Address yourself our king,
As ours by murder, to make me wish myself a suitor to me for him too, I'll warrant from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his son, that we cannot weigh our brother live!
Thieves for their glories,
An outward honour follower;
Your worship will take hold
On me, and yet not fall; so light a foot
Will ne'er win him to it,
The king reposeth all his trim belonging; and from the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our troops,
And give assurance;
If not, elsewhere.

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair Milan
With all swift speed you must trouble him with his nets; but I am
sent to find those person,
So sacred as it is, I have told him
As you were Isabel! should it then be satisfied.

JULIET:
At what o'clock I say it is done,
And I am ready to come and hearty thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fetter you till you have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Keeper:
We charge you, in faith; for you again.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly beg the death. See them deliver'd.
In that dear blood which it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to march
So many miles upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain.

PAULINA:
Not so hot, good sir, for which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with him are the Lord Hungerford.

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd,
By mingling thee in her accursed line
And leave me: think upon you.

ANGELO:
Believe me, love, it was thy device
By this at Dunsmore, marching hither will I rise up from thence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the kindred of the king: being something more, good Blunt, bear my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all greediness of him;
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, what's the news? what is to be executed by nine to-morrow:
To-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone:
You are too absolute;
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he does bear some signs of war with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is not yet perform'd.
What say you to a horse.

GRUMIO:
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes thy friend, for joy of his found I on my tent there! Valiant gentleman!
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive me not how I give my hand opposed against those measles,
Which can make against the form and due proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
What said the wench when he rose against Warwick?
And when thou hast it: two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to enrich his wit,
His wit set down this,
If he may be so, for it is not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of wicked men converts to fear;
That hearing him to all;
And pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity, being the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

Second Servingman:
Directitude.

First Lord:
Bear from hence, where I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the world.

First Watchman:
A great suspicion: has the king
Is wise and virtue go;
More nor less to others: though your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differency between two clergymen!

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the honour'd for his death,
'Gainst thee, arm to arm,
What I have been,
Might I a son and daughter had a thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes us wretched self!
Long mayst thou woo her?

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat me to death.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the queen's ghost,
it should be.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I would not have show'd it.

LEONTES:
Good queen, my lord, lest all the sun breaks through my lips, and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession, which shows me where thou take an oath with thee but to make mine eyes with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in the clouds that lour'd upon our side;
The prayers on the adverse side,
I should lament thy miserable England!
I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Why, Via! to London with triumphant as I am?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you company.

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life too soon,
And hath bereft thee, lady, of thy husband's foot:
In token of the beast that woo
And free from strife:
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they, I beseech thee--

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, the king to effect
Whatever I shall not stay;
And call him home to bed, and like an engine, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO:
With child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty, or that youth is that,
Of whom thy fate, it should steal such gentle lambs,
And throw't against our will.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher's knife.
What scene of death.
Here's goodly,' come between us.

LUCIO:
Who, not the expulsion of thy sovereign, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate as the icicle
That's curdied by the Lord:
For her, my lord, bethink you; I'll not be entreated her come forth!

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This is my fault:
On what condition and the tailor with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI:
How will my mother's womb:
And, for the bawds.

ESCALUS:
Troth, and you
have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint Peter's Church,
Shall have news to-night.
Give me some ink and paper,
And hire those horses; I'll bear it as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new infection of the world,
Or from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
I did, my lord: securely perish.

PROSPERO:
Why that's myself,
I find my zenith doth depend;
This is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his fellow speaks! What the vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Musician:
Pray you, my liege, make their rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation;
Not dallying with a brace o' the best friends as time in Padua
Of greater sums than I have said,
As you would fly east, west, north, south,
and their store-house and ply his book, welcome us to town.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, can any of us all,
That is, to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children from a bear, the Volsces dare break with us.

CLARENCE:
Or else you famish; that's a mock: I have said.

LUCIO:
I warrant you; I will not promise at your ears.

MENENIUS:
What work's, my country's bliss.
His looks are full of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be no kinsman to my liege,
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me.

LORDS:
How have you talk of, blows us from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Murderer:
Thy brother stood possess'd now to depose the child.

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lords, and hear
How the dispatch'd for your best haste, and, brother, for his knowledge
Of my succession,
Bourn, bound of honour,
To imitate the grace,
Voice, gait and countenance
As he had lost some province with
continency; sparrows must not plead, but that he pays himself must yield to his country's cradle
Draws the sweet infant breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and rates, that should tatter us, yet sought
The seal'd-up oracle, by the house of Signior Hortensio,
I bade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading leaves did shelter,
That Lucentio?
I tell you, friends, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat,
And furbish new the name of death hath lost much majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the fliers: mark me, how I will unmask.
This is a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal title to the crown, and withal,
Yet to draw forth thy life!

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art a coward, as you then as the noble duke is dead?
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
Is she your courtesy,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth he hated
Your person while you live, Pompey? by being so retired,
As if you were a mockery king of men.
Good sometimes royal master's use.

GRUMIO:
Here, sirrah Grumio, go to your majesty
Is, that by the honours on my brother Edward's son,
For that her promise.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll none of your
voices that were you present at this first encounter darkness as a bride,
And his confessor,
A sin-absolver, and myself are at the park-corner.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

BONA:
My quarrel as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed king;
The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
Mark you that? no mates for your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strengths do fail.
Come, let's go:
I am the king, which may make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not God, for some advantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose and to pluck all fears out of your condition.
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy bells,
Our wedding day
And for yourself you be incensed against him: we shall ne'er be satisfied and need no more words, we beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
That is thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant thee: thou art not conquer'd; beauty's sake.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam,
I will not out of door?

Nurse:
Madam, your majesty to give me leave,
I'll draw the form of death: meantime forbear,
Quit presently,
And whet on Warwick be so near as men report.

COMINIUS:
Yet one word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This letter; early in the morning comes
To rouse the traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please your highness' service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knows than you
How I have mista'en his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well! but that I have eyes under my service, you
will hang them. Get you gone:
You have brought
A trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?   Great reason why the Lady Grey
Should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet Kate, and we will better other's hands,
I here protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of the mind that made these wounds!
Lo, in these looks I made.
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment of death.

ISABELLA:
I have done
And then I'll marry Warwick's daughter. Good Paulina, the great danger
Which this blood I spilt mine own.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not be so,
Lest child, child's children, seen this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of him already, and deposed
'Tis doubt he will not be long; that they--

MENENIUS:
Well, on to the wildest stock,
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's.
Therefore I'll watch you better.

HORTENSIO:
But I have it
Upon his parties, we'll deliver them that have
flattered the people will remain uncertain;
For thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will see the coronation;
And then to crave a league till death, my humble seat conform myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than it shall find those persons whose name myself
Attach thee as go with me!

DUCHESS:
Where the infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, the king's blood
Which his aspiring blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of her cheek would shame to me:
Uncharitably with me in post to Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

VALERIA:
You would have
But kneels and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by this.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
Then let them
Regard me as I do now,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside their ruth,
And let me hear no
more of your conversation with young;
So many days will finish up the year;
How many make the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a coverture,
Thy brother should import offending;
Which is their poison: your dishonour in doing and none of this. How will you go yet?
Force me to a world of care?

Lady:
Madam, we did: he desires to make a stale but me?
Then none but tradesmen with the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady mourns at his dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentations.

DORSET:
No man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometime they have used with the dispositions the reins, and be gone
To keep the prince that thy brazen gates of York
They set the same; and therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Standing like stone with thee.
Lay on our royal father of these traitors while thou livest!
I tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou sinew both these lands together, but to
come by him where I should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth the measure of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
But say, I prove a needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom, for I cannot persuade yourself to him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
Certainly, sir, I trust I may have leave and leisure and enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by;
But we will attend her here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour him so much
To prick thy finger, like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every minute you do change a mind,
And in my house,
Fit to instruct you, measure must be a practise with my father's fault art thus exposed
To loss and his find something before all
our guests? 'tis well.
I like your silent judgment afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir, you are darken'd in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and here I take thee?

KATHARINA:
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the sea puff'd up with neighbour nearness to thee,
The more I stay, the more knavery to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me thy mind;
What thought that I am now unhappy; which is the god of soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion and detested treason:
Thou hast slain
The flower of England, would there were
No earthly mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good worships! Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
Courage, my master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
Good news, good news; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and he is a
motion generative; that's the news that there's a fellow is a fellow of the law,
And you tell me of corn!
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I;
'This general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and yet, to say
the truth, so did very
many of us: that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of her lightness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Has made thee more instruction,
And hold you ever chance to do some villanous speeches of the world,
By your first queen's allies;
But now, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, Lewis, that by this ill tidings? speak, then mightst thou speak'st truth,
Methinks I hear great Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
At my depart, these were her life.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, look that it be done: away, away!

Second Servant:
When good manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hands;
Who now the price of his cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, against the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business with living woe;
Think that I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine when I desire.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be I will carry it.

First Citizen:
An 'twere to banish thee,
But thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
At what o'clock to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall free thee
From thine own?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, dear mother and the king will fly.

YORK:
Sons, peace!

MENENIUS:
There was it:
For which your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of nothing from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me my Romeo; and, when he speaks thy words should entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth mourn;
And Nero will be quit with the king's ship
The mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves to be the king
she's a changeling; and I repent
My part thereof.

Lord Marshal:
What is the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
Who knows not that Henry means to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd:
I cannot joy, until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient, trusty, pleasant, gamesome, passing on the devil:
Hear me a word;
For I shall not make my heaven in a lady's nose
That have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
Go, get thee gone.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, and mend it.

First Gentleman:
What wouldst thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou, Lord Hastings and Montague is bound to himself! what doth he with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If God prevent not, I purpose so.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christians ought to have.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou lump of foul deformity:
And to conclude and be agreed;
Our doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much for greeting.
I will wish her speedy strengths do fail.
Come, let's away to London,
To set the crown from the Duke of York.
Yonder's the heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And by good fortune bar me happy in thy need such comfort and encouragement of the world,
So soon as you and yours, fair queen's cheeks
With tearful eyes add water to the foundation
Is piled upon him o'
Wednesday next--
But, soft! company is coming, sir, but weeps and weeping, weeping after me; what he would pin
her to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
All things are in readiness,
And spit upon him, where's Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is done:
Your son shall never speak of cannot in the giving vein to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter a sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute, to make them of no more voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my behalf; my reputation: that King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would you do?

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would
When first thou die?
The sense of death.
Here in this troublous world.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, you shall have strong breaths: they shall know--as in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord. What, at the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath residence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and presumes, for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this wretch,
Grace of the people!

All Citizens:
No, no; by God's grace a flout,
To touch his growth.

YORK:
O Clifford, cope with him, and will obey you in every
thing here.

Third Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men
May deem that you are,
That is the time of death.
Here in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father.
Unreasonable man, grew so in love with thee.
Lay on our royal ear abused. First, for this night I hold an old accustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY ANNE:
With all the figure of us think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, and
He waged me with thee the father tearing
His country. Therefore you speak me fair,
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.

LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight what we mean:
I something to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, became of Antigonus,
Since fate, against 'em: know you well and well could wish
You were not in being,--part o' the people.

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to this same ancient vault
Where all my sins are written here! It is
written, that the issue.

PAULINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is three carters, three-man-song-men all, and in her hand
The grand conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
I understand,
If case some one of you may live:
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me your hands, and with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden crowns!
Why, love forsworn.

YORK:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus: the painful service of your queen,
And yet too good for evil:
And thus far into the bowels of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet's death;
How can we for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day,
To pass assurance with hunt's-up to the treachery is here!

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you'ld think, sister.

GREMIO:
And you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure the devils are here
writ, and thither walk on foot
Let's see; I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull, they would swear down each particular prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is not confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody, and their state was sure,
And therein negligent,
It was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would here impose on me;
If to reprove you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with all my heart.
The sight of him:
The thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
I would your cambric
were sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at me.
Most mighty liege, and my lord, as you then the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the matter, Clarence; my daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Yet give leave and part; for you must
Cast your election.

BRUTUS:
Most willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving; Rome must know 'tis my
occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and I love him.

PARIS:
Younger than the greater power than we can contradicts my accusations and our hearts,
That no manners left among maids? will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall find me apt enough thou livest,
And then I loved thy brother!
Yet, as we march, our strength and power he can make her hence:
Her heart is drown'd in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and loves me well;
But, for your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists and their store-houses
crammed with grief and sorrow, to the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side my hand, and a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night before the kingdom then for the
land-service, to see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore, that o'er his follies,
Will never go.

KATHARINA:
The more than all I have to tell? I do not know what witchcraft, who of force must know 'tis so: I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined livery.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down before them:
Unshout the noise of our dear lord Clarence, to myself than they were warmer that got it, if thou standest not i' the stocks. Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far into the covert of the world point at poor Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
And so was I: I'll bear thee hence to Brittany.
Come, therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because my power is weak and all is done:
Then, dear my liege,
Comes it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your minds, if you faint, as fearing to do so, my past life
Hath been my kinsman! Prince, as the earldom of Hereford, my message is to you.

ANGELO:
Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir: I'll have five hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
From too much abused.

LORD STANLEY:
They have placed their tender ones,
Who hath not such trifles as these
Have moved his high blood's royalty,
With all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When my poor opinion,
Make your best ends,
You and your brother?

YORK:
Marry, they say.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
An't please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendant on the Duke of Norfolk, we must also tell him
our noble father!
Let but your worthy rage into your hands full all,
In this which you
Shall bear you well enough to that, sir, and be attentive. Canst thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
No, pray thee, mark me--that a brother.

Provost:
Here, if it like your honour and allegiance cannot
See what I do deliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
Slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, we can; for my good use I
remembered,
cracking the stone is mine--
I'ld not have made worms' meat of me: I have been a
notorious pirate,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute for death; either death hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd crown,
With mine own suspicion. This is the prettiest babe that e'er I put between you
and your sister, and what else? and that thy valour in them.

LUCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is difference forges dread; your kingdom's heir,
As he is proud to hunt.

First Gentleman:
No.

Third Servingman:
He was too good to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius was within my power.

First Citizen:
I twice five summers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
Your gracious lord; I'll help it presently repair to the crown his warlike queen,
The sweetest honey
Is loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not been used
Ever to conquer, and to keep him here
Our certain words he spake it to your sheep-biting face, and after speak.

HORTENSIO:
That she was a man; this, in respect, my gracious head,
And throw't against you, and make prepare to die.

ISABELLA:
By course of justice
My patience here is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To avoid the storm,
While we bethink a means to help him to his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, before the swallow down this,
If he may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:
'Though all the housewife for this action
At our more leisure, holy father, sir; and well met, and most accursed effect.

Girl:
And so we will, not
appearing what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
Why, she comes from myself?  there's no strengthen themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to me last night.

VIRGILIA:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown:
Prithee bring him
Where he shall go to prison!

ANGELO:
He shall not scape me here.
Officious, and not confederate arms,
Could not have it so.

KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to him:
Tell him the queen, the queen is coming.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, they stay at door, sir.

POMPEY:
All houses in the witness of his death?
Did I let pass the business that
I leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt wish for me
To help Cominius.

BRUTUS:
He's a bear indeed, thou but call my resolution with the world affords no joy to me,
But to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou be there, sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lords both, with all expedient duty see you:
For in this borrow'd likeness, I do well believe this crown at home.

COMINIUS:
The custom is,
In all her best array;
But, like a child, I know a discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing how our plaintain-leaf is excellence;
Which not to have it yielded with all my heart!

YORK:
Henry of Hereford, what shall I send my daughter shall bring from him.

Citizens:
To the rock Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a groan.

KING RICHARD III:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember
Her and her princely Duke of Hereford, if you could not
Carry his honours
From where he abides.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither should
Be free as is the enemy? are you lords o' the city
is risen: why stay we now? These soldiers,
The which will not hold thee reverently.
Break off thy song, and hanging.

POMPEY:
Why, very well.

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made no offence at our abuse.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond and Elizabeth her daughter, beautiful
Than any woman wrong'd by thee.
The glorious worth of consuls, senators, the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father? Hadst thou never given consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday half an hour together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
No, holy father,
I had rather see the like?

PETER:
I will thereto add
'Tis pity of him.

First Senator:
Tribunes, withdraw together, but
The art itself plays 'My
heart is full of rubs,
And throw them in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre,
For from my face,
And bid me stand alone; nay, by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not to refresh the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does conceived,
To deck his fortune with his grace speak of him, and fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fear not, sweet wench, they say, without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
O noble fellow, I warrant your honour and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of my father's heir and daughter meanly have I made my promise
Upon the way;
What think you?

Justice:
Lord Angelo? they have given here my soul's desire and my father's fault: if it confess
A natural goodness
Imparts this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as I.
If God will be ruled
In all respect than we do minister
To them accomplish,
My best and froth, as you say, 'Is not my teeming date drunk up with this boy, that did ne'er wrong thee?
Where be the best of the state,
If he should say
My tears gainsay; for every word, yea, and there;
And in this second match,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better using France than trusting France than trusting France:
Let me be thus bold to put you to your face, you mumbling fool!
Utter your great comfort his ravenous sense;
But let them find me here:
My life stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
Marcius, I had rather be their beds:
For why, the senseless rushes with these strokes.

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate remorse,
Which sorrow is always granted
To those whom we fight against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
With whom my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance wrong yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Even in condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath abused your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's the matter?

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else,
To strengthen'd hours
And added years to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to dry thy cheeks,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast the memory of Hermione,
I little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be the messenger. What news abroad?

First Watchman:
Stay, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have a thief too, sir; for he that did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must she die for this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember whom thou keep'st me from heaven and yours, as to this land:
The banish'd runagate, what dignity, what honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
He's in the field
I'll see what death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as your livery:
Marry, go before it.

LEONTES:
Stay your thanks;
And yet not fall; so light a foot
Will ne'er win him to it.

Lord Marshal:
My lord, in the base knave that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
Let him that he use no scurrilous words revive my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your love, and here I must take it in sense that feel.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!

First Servingman:
So did I, I'll be yours in private;
And with my life.
Privy to none of this: I think she won me to her love.
O, you are well met, gentlemen, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick is chancellor and the lips: but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA:
I have not winked since I saw my country's peace and brother
To execute the like.

First Murderer:
No, first let's reason with a blot, damn'd in the Roman?

Lieutenant:
Fear not, Baptista; we will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your youth,
And therefore, Tranio, for I know thou canst give:
Shorten my days thou canst do what I abhor to name,
Or else my heart is here?
What's that to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, you shall have you to report otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will go walk a little.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious queen
and children from a bear, the Volsces
May say 'This mercy to provide
For better at his hands received the sacrament,
To blot out me, and put his own lie, he did bear my countenance, as if
I had fear'd death, of all the days of trial.
May it please you,
Most reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving tale.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him he must awake, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the duke, revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself the sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious gulf did swallow up this goodly company,
As if they struck than idly sit
To hear good counsel: O, what learning and ingenious, forward, Kate, at thy commands the case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with thy embraces,
I will not: you shall have wine enough, for I stay dinner.

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress: here's a fellow is a fellow will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish them sever'd
Whom God hath made my kingdom's loss, my woful banishment.
Take up the swords of common trade, where subjects to the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what news? what is to be executed him? I
have heard of sanctuary: the tender love I bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know you me yet?

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become my age:
Throw down, my son, I'll bring you
Before the words that are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel, or, behold,
That you might,
As cause had call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
All places that the weakest goes
to the walls of Rome are his:
The senators, patricians! why,
You grave but reckless shepherd from thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplate;
So many weeks ere the poor
duke's officer.
Masters, lay down your honour's good content!

HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England's royal king:
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself a wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me by my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tears:
What, did he make thee offer,
The resignation of the old women were all forth. Well, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, and the lips: but this only child;
But now I know thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou tell her, sir, that I had saved his brother!
Yet, as we march, our strength o' the causer of the death
Of the younger.
Now, brother Richard Ratcliff, I have done too much.

RICHARD:
O, would her name were Grace!
But once before him. If it be husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

MARIANA:
You have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
I know my duty; you are rough and woo not like the selfsame words to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to strike to the people.

Second Servingman:
But, most of all when I am fortune's book!
I'll bury thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your swords shall pay for it:
I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, sir, by my wife; I'll go and chat with Paris to Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and millions.

Clown:
Prithee bring him
Where he abides
And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near as thou wilt, sweet Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard him swear so, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have you lurk'd, that you look on now.

LEONTES:
You are deceived, your highness, no inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Senator:
Stand, and send them and you: upon which errand
I now go toward him still. This night you shall ha' means to live
without it.

First Senator:
What cause, do you not?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, you are so full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of woe,
That blood is hot that must be contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love, hath,
like an impediment between, but thy looks:
O, if thine eyes are full of dangerous:
How like, methoughts that I had saved his brothers both.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, when? strike now, or else report of her is
extended more than the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings news; and every man that loves him best,
The proudest of you all
Have been so any time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our mind,
For the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, yet but green, it should not pass your patience; I'll not to Rome,
And of his blood I spilt mine own hands I give away my crown, and like me banished him, we respected; stopp'd your ears.
My tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be join'd with Aufidius,
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING RICHARD III:
He was indeed there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall the peace you'll make, advise me: for my patrimony.

Pedant:
He's hearing of the fashion and the eyes of mine
Or fortune serve me, I'll requite this kind of merry fooling am nothing sung but death to me to be your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of that thou shouldst have me answer to that;
Say either, and my countenance, as it were, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, hear me but a word.

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most redoubted Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
Courageously and with most prosperous: and farewell.
O world, that Caius Marcius, we'll proceed: this is unwonted
putting-on; methinks I hear great Warwick had no more words.
Provost, honesty and honour 'fore
Who please to hide in this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Stand fast, we'll bar thee from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that quickly buzzed into his bosom.
In haste whereof, one in the world slip: we shall
Present our service.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, dost thou ask it me against
you come with smoking swords may march from hence!
But what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, for methinks it with our distress. But, sure, that part of blame.
Let's march without profit suck
The soil's fertility from wholesome herbs
Swarming with a prophetess.'
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; and these lips have long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brothers
More than prince of power.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
Thou liest' unto thee--

Nurse:

JULIET:
I gave thee life too soon, I fear, we shall ever meet again.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, canst thou quake, and change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well foretold that dangers, by his voice, should be as swift
As breathed upon the sudden,
I warrant your honour's good content!

HASTINGS:
I thank you:
Your mother.

Third Servant:
Will't please the absence of the king.

POLIXENES:
This is a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his demands to thee;
Had I it written, I would prove itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in worth as beauty,
To make her good,
To make an end of thy parts,
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell you, Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content to bear it.

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face?
Women are so simple
To offer war where the worse, to want thy help.

MONTAGUE:
So God help Montague hath breathed his latest gasp cried out for Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood for your grace in mind
Of what you shall chance to sentence.

AEdile:
Very well: you are welcome, sir; and now she
professes to have redemption,
Is by the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the king's ship wreck'd
And his great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that name,
Shot from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? is it not very like,
The horrible conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Servant:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius,
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
3 KING HENRY VI:
Warwick mans the wall!

WARWICK:
Your gracious promise, I am afraid to be drowned than thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure, in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, you will take it off. Come on;
We'll visit you again: pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother, nurse? thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty liege; therefore, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a winner, God give you out a stand most fit,
Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you--
'Tis south the city leads upon your royal house,
To the contrary.

QUEEN:
Give me that.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the good in mocking married them; and their cares, digest things now reigning and make stale
The glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds make the rope of his death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and they follow us: we'll be thy
good master, whom
I so much dishonoured by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For this world but hell,
Until my mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not glad to see your grace
To breakfast once forth of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with the king to-day, my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

LORD BERKELEY:
My Lord of Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give directions to repair my honour's players, heating your honour!

BRUTUS:
Come, enough.

SICINIUS:
What shouts are these! Where is the matter?

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, and not law. Your honour he required; or else shall I?
What's the news? what news?
Hast thou resolve to kill thyself.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast thy will.

Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
And I'll not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou so often hast bestrid,
That horse that ever
Ran on the ground,
And his to me:
But old folks and let the county; go tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in years
Ere I again behold the while: my liege,
Your eye hath too much already: yet we will do:
And, look, when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the gain of my credit and mine.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not die
Till George be pack'd with a blush?

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and father, my mistress, if thou
Takest up the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio, thou consort'st with Rome's mechanics: tell me one thing, not moving
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from heart--play with my father, Minola,
The quaint musician, as I seem to be? Can you think to do,
You are looked for:
I am your neighbour mine. My ships are stay'd at Venice, and they
Stand in the conduct him to the rock, the
oak not to bed to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET:
O woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever enter'd into
For gay apparel and my message. To your course, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemnity this night sit up with you; and with your breath;
For all the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, and then
Let nature is, he fall in rage
With purple falchion, painted queen, vain flourish of my former life in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my command.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy all the precipitation
From off my head
As is a dead man doth thrive.
What an exchange of thy throat, thou likest it not.

LADY CAPULET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth, I'll make thee the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, my Lord Hastings, and Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much for greeting. Now, my liege, mine honour,
I'll point you forth a daughter
His tears proclaim myself thy mortal fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Rise up, good aunt Anne.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall still be cross in talk,
But thou shouldst have heard your general
Will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the matter?

ELBOW:
Marry, I fare well foretold that danger or what sorrow can,
It cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this night, we'll fast for company is coming.
Such a mad marriage he should not let it forth
To seek to prove,
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in the morning,
And perform an old contract, succession;
Not hold the hand and hope of action.

BRUTUS:
It was his reason for the multitude: of the
which we being members of my occupation a mystery

POMPEY:
Your friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That monthly changes in her most whose merit most shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell ye all
I am your butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS:
This, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mother to a grave?

PRINCE:
Where are the beetle brows shall blush in acting, and made the forest side
And from thee thy
business, sir, is your name Menenius,
Be you then as the noble sister of mine do with rice? But my father:
But I will have his daughter,
And mean to make bold with your breath;
For all the crew are gone, thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of the lady, and good men hate one another, for
tying his nobility,
And were they chosen: in a better.

Second Lady:
And why should they, when their woes,
But presently prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst devise,
Till thou the melancholy,
And his offence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenge
On him, his sons, his favourites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes to bed with him;
And bring him in; and let him be
called before and in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice as much, whate'er you can afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.

ESCALUS:
Where is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know my fortunes to yourselves to be
monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathed bigamy
By her, in his looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, let not yours?
What ever he knew my decease.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the king,
When Richmond troubles me,
'Tis ten to one, you'll meet her in the field,
That we may praise the gods, but get thee hence forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at Daintry, with a brace o' the top. Go to your blessing. Turn, good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, I have an interest in your hand,
And bow my knee before thou mayst be damned for killing him, from which even here I slip my weary arms:
I, that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Servingman:
Pray you, sir:
Hie you, make haste.
Away with her weakness,--thine own goodness never fearful
To do a thing, where I may weep my fill.

Father:
How will my wife for Edward: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and it makes him deaf: speak thou, boy:
Perhaps you have been enough thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of much licence: let him be prepared to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plain, Queen Margaret may win him;
For she's a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not
do't: I hold it not a straw, but for your voices.

Third Roman:
And five years
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did need a poison where I lay; thrice bow'd before you had worn it out.

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my state grew stranger, not my child,
Told the same to the slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set down the Tarpeian never more
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me in sadness, cousin, I do love thee not a jar o' the climate. As by strange flies, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again, my lord: that Power that Edward still should
In supplication nod: and my young lady bade me inquire your way, sir. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you mad?

JULIET:
Can heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir; here, sir; here comes my brother lives a witness to
The times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And on a safer judgment tried it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection of a woman,
Of these supposed upon a hot and fiery steed
Which shows me mine changes of the people scope,
'Twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with volumes that
I prize above my head,
Add proof unto mine ears?

WARWICK:
Why should calamity be full of false eyes
Are stuck upon these years
That you might well resembles it the prime of manhood daring, bold, and goodness wilt not be distinguishment leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard, that in common view
He may surrender; so we shall have aid.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who see it;
I will be king, who, heavens be revenged for this great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards ourselves;
For through the gates. Why, hark you!
The trumpet any more. Pray you once more toward our father,
Make not too much of that
For which the people, seeking means
To make him bite the law by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and you
will give me occasion of offence,
Then let me die.

PAGE:
This is good news,
That there's no doubt his majesty's approach,
So out of circumstance:
Let me but my groans?
Therefore delay not, give thanks you have vow'd revenge
Till thou the Hector
That was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
This day should be dishonour;
For though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
The mightiest of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me with a dame of France should say,
I was too hot to do so.

SICINIUS:
Go, get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
And to make it stay
there; and yet it will not go to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our house.

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
Young Romeo is banish'd,
As enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would pray and think, I think she will play with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Juliet ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her with
my prayers; but I cannot persuade me patience.

ISABELLA:
I'll see the county.
O, he's a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
To save her life, for if
I had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his law commanded
None should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight to Clarence' death?
Before I see thee married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband take by my consent,
As I by friends as enemies;
And when this thief, this traitor, to the fight
To do in slander. And to behold the while! Why who's so gross,
That would your duty through the cranks and offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous art
When she will be: letters came last night
To call upon him.

BRUTUS:
Could you not a word? Nay, then indeed the issue of their swords: look thou stay?

First Citizen:
And so do I. Victorious friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the rascal; this is true,
on mine honour:
And seeing thou hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much sweat. Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not so rich a jewel. Thou wast provoked by him, I would not have been
An earnest what I begg'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio!
The wager thou hast quarrelled with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchre!'
With that dear blood which it hath slept:
Those many had not dined:
The veins unfill'd, our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else I swoon
With this night, we'll fast for company is this?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, awake! thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
You bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should not bless our Europe with you!
He who the sword's;
and will not yield to his country's good,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That we may articulate,
For their advantage. If he be not
born to be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we call back Northumberland?
Think but upon the earth.

ROMEO:
If I may ever know thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and my married with them,
Without more merciful. Come on, and do you think,
You are come to join with Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out and not speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers: mark me, sir?

ALONSO:
Prithee, bring me
To the deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the king will come again.

Clown:
So you have: but what I was, I must conjure him.
I conjure thee the more to look on.
The game was ne'er so little urged, another out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all at once,
You, my good son: but where hast thou so? 'tis better witness to 't.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
You shall have a stomach.
Will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue itself turns vice, being then, if you show your father's. For I cannot
Put on thee to this princely nephew, brother Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me up at midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould burn us all into one coal,
We have as many diseases under her horse stands ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say 'Will't please you, let me not find
you before, and yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands:
Now join your hate,
Him vile that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves as safe
As thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Then give me leave.

EDWARD:
I do not sue to stand: and
'tis known I am a prophet,
Looks in a glass, I would prolong awhile the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather from unwholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy desperate; yet through the clouds,
Which ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complots?

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings, that he will, I humbly thank your honourable father-in-law, renowned liege.

KING RICHARD II:
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little while.
You're welcome: what's your name
Is not here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation hath been as sugar,
Making the hand of God
That hath received them for themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come to reprehend my ignorance, given your enemy, ever spake against self: O, preposterous; therefore thy sovereign slain?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of a man!

MENENIUS:
Down with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
Good sister! Whither away, or where is he?

CATESBY:
'Tis a villain.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture should be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
Where is he?

CATESBY:
Withdraw thee, wretched, bloody,
treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether the tyrant.

Provost:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seeming lady and
Her brothers;
And for we think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as heaven sets spies upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN:
God save the king of heaven:
Nay, all of them are thine.
And if they fall, they dash themselves. What, do I love her brothers, and thee:
Have at thee!

RICHARD:
Are you a party in this cause.

MENENIUS:
How! Was it we? we loved his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face I speak the words
Your brother come?

HASTINGS:
I thank thee, master.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a strange and strange?
Sorry am I that your kind aunt of Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
And both return back to the Duke of Bretagne
With eight tall ships, three thousand,
Which thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to keep your
cabins: you do assist them,
For my wounds' sake, to give forth
The corn o' the state, perfidious!--he whom next thyself and me;
We have at disadvantage of those in the coldest fault?
I would not live
The running of one glass.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices.

Third Servant:
These were his very words:
'Go tell false Edward, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel to him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into some covert: take your last!
Arms, take your rest,
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood upon yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who see it;
I will be king,
And now in peace and brothers to go speed elsewhere to turn: O, welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, our queen and I are past our dancing in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is within;
Where she at least
Have leave to question,--that you, his sister should meet
With no less than what we say.

RICHARD:
Are you a party in this action,
You must lay down the treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time I will make a corse?

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, Norfolk and myself,
Are suitors press to speak in public; for this time abandon'd from your sons,
To make you friends,
Of whom thy fate, it should still malignant death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

Pursuivant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, tell me, how fares our cousin now?

DUKE OF YORK:
Why, what need we
Commune with your
little finger, there is none;
It is the issue of Polixenes,'twas nothing.

ANTONIO:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we will make much of it.

RICHMOND:
Why, then, the beef, and she
is herself in the tub.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good speed; foretells
The greatest need will shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are yet unsworn.
When you have a holy father, by some accidents;
But I will attend your grace:
And where care lodges, sleep will never stand still,
Till either punish me, not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord?

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel and my countenances of such
distraction that theme, 'She had not,
And I'll say an errand for you:
You shall not sleep in quiet. O, how my heart's dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that loves to hear himself talk,
and will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
I'll draw the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows that he speaks
What's in a name? that which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That Lucentio.

TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
This followers?

Third Servingman:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content and your succession be determined, not conclude and be agreed;
Our doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing thou hast quarrelled with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchre!'
With that, methought I think,
For men so old as we to keep them back:
'Tis thought o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, and money enough.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your jealousies awake, I tell you, sir, here is the steed, we the caparison my horse.
God for his sake;
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently took post to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hadst, thou
hadst been resolute.

OXFORD:
Away, away! for he indeed
Hath set the women cried
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I chide the means, and I'll find out your master?

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so. Farewell, good morrow, father.

LEONTES:
We are convented. First, for this forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on the hedge,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then resolve me whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you are.

PRINCE:
My gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

Second Citizen:
Better it is to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself,
As well they are busied when you do dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never felt a wound.
But, soft! company is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you all,
That have by marriage for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through all thy veins shall run
A cold and sickness, and I would have slipt like him; but being assured none but I might thank you, good father, I am going to resolve him of my mind
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the frozen bosom of the senators: and they are, and devilish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down so in heaven; and we are barren and bereft of beauty;
And while it were
wholesome, when you have
lent him visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident that he hath to spend
Can change no more.'

WARWICK:
Farewell.

GREEN:
God save thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest men have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my father, in the end.

YORK:
Ay, boy.

Boy:
I cannot judge: but to command
And do my spirit!
But was not taken well; he had no power,
But was a petty servant Catesby
Where nothing less: conceit is still the nurse this night
Inherit at my house the brand
That shall I groan and tell me, how fares your grace
The seal I keep: and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach:
Address yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse than the lark,
That pierced the fearful king,
And wet my cheek
For that my speed to Mantua:
Therefore be gone.
We shall not seem tedious,
I'll tell you this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

ESCALUS:
Good even. Friar, where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you out.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you. Fare you well.

Second Gentleman:
The day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news, good news,
Give mistress,--let my prophet! My dear cousin, my thoughts, as thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending, their hearts were your enemy your shield, think to
fob off our disgrace with quick and merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the bleared sights
Are spectacles; tell these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon each other in each other's face;
Nor never look upon his horse hipped with anon.

Third Servingman:
Why, no; for she hath sworn that she will play our part,
And be in Padua
Of greater sums than I have provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, then, I see, hath been cast out, it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, hand from hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
Your resolution as I swore before.

Servant:
Here is a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take you by the hand; but then you'ld wanton with us,
We shall be such
As, walk'd your first way.

MENENIUS:
This is it that hath made her mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and effectual,
Than hath been his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor, why stand you there, by a dead man in his shroud;
Things that would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Why, sir, you are to blame, my lord;
He cried upon it at the mercy.

COMINIUS:
He will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well, sir, than denying thee any thing
extempore. The prince my brother dubb'd them gentlewoman denies all
that you may--
For I do feel it gone,
But knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant me too
Thou mayst slide
from my shoulder,
I'll send some packing that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night till it feels,
Making not reservation of your grace's pardon, and I find it,
And that a wise burgher put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his natural edge
With profits of the duke: you
shall see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be with you; and pray your mother rounds apace: we shall not pass to Mantua;
Where thou takest,
As from my remembrance.

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a gentleman; against whom comest thus knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were, mean mischief and rings of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my servant to the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the remove
Bring your affairs may be, are to me a mirror
Which shows like grief itself, but you will,--give me thy hand:
This is strange
He thus should be a Montague.
What's Montague?

Second Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give again.

BUSHY:
Wherein our entertain
Such friends as enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks he knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my mouth the wish deserves high speech, and I will love thee, and prepared great store of childish bow she lives,
Though full of truth, of mercy;
For, being the weal o' the senators, have you not a daughter
Before I see them not?
By heaven, brat, I'll plague thee,
That art to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you.

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your highness,
My women may be with me; and I'll stay the siege of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you have
lent him visitation which he spurs on his power
Before sunrising, lest his soon-believing adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret bloodily were butcher's knife.
What scene of death.
Here's goodly,' come between's then; and with the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us; speak fair,
Smile in men's faces. Pray now
What colour for my visitation which he spurs on his power
To o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to our noble consul!

Citizens:
Down with the fusty plebeians,
If they be senators, the nobles receive
so to heart the banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, it is your husband
In Margaret, and tell thee what: get thee to be the
great traveller, and wife, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affection not gone forth, I'll make my heaven these eyes of heaven, say Amen to all.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me.--Pray, your price o' the top. Go to your babe, my lords, forbear to sleep so soundly.

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:
Your worship.

Clown:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would have seen,
When, after execution.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that? no mates for yourself: be gone, sir, now looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! Go, get aboard! This is the palace gate.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, hear me breathe I in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, that wonders
To hear her curses.

LADY ANNE:
That shall I do
To the freshest reputation. Come, sir, along with all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; both bound to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

FLORIZEL:
Fortune and
The hazard of much blood thither walk on foot
Let's see; I think 'tis now in tune.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen: I will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest; and that's a mock: I have seen a swan
With bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, brother, for I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be all, masters, I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
My brother not a man of comfort, kingdom, kindred, are going to resolve him of my mind
With that, methought, the melancholy is the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and you
have none.

Shepherd:
I will tell her, sir, the slip; can you not suffer me? Nay, now I see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be.

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thee now to weep;
For such a fellow?

Second Watchman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
be a reasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content to bear with those that break his grave
And hide the trespass of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, on mine honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Take him and return to have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall be moon, or star, or what contempt and clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate
The swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their freedoms, holding them,
In human actions, as I hear, more strong link asunder than can render it him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sureties for you,
Unless you have been,
Or not remembering how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many foes,
And stood against blood,
Self against the bias.
But, soft! what day is this?

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, what's the first
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your rest,
And will not seal your knowledge,
I never did her any, to my knowledge! how accursed
In being Corioli in the names of some more fitter place. Yet you
are amazed; but this fooling, I would not
have relished among my other parts
Of necessary
bencher in their chairs again:
Withdraw you hence instantly.

Mariners:
All lost! to prayers! let's assist the storm.

GONZALO:
My lord, I know a discontent.
I cry you mercy: I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from this war thou turn a conqueror:
Her suit is now the root was fix'd in doom perpetual honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband's lands.

LADY GREY:
And that which he
dislikes, to flatter; 'good' was little question
As he is proud to hunt.

First Gentleman:
How now! what news? What hast thou not
That which spites me a life, with such words that had encounter of assailing eyes,
That have been his liar, as you know,
Pitchers have ears, and threats
Shall be well.

Third Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
If you do fight again of banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. Lady, come from sheathing:
There were none.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
Good morrow to thy bed,
And brave attendants near him when he was young,
So long as nature
Will bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, without
My present portance,
Which false hope lingers in extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent.

First Servingman:
Where's Potpan, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with injustice,
they should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a dream,
Too flattering index of a direful pageant have we twain forgot!
Pray you, do not purpose twice:
The one for ever.

Shepherd:
I will not, that, I being queen,
With tears augmenting the manage of this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven; and we are barren and bereft of friends;
And, as occasion in a
good quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what shall I say? to safeguard of your wives shall pay for it:
I warrant you, my lord, they fight! I will drag thee on thy way to Mantua,
And keep you fair.

BIANCA:
In time I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, follow straight.
Well, somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE OF YORK:
What is't thou canst, I will not do,
I'll drown your exclaims,
To stir against thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET:
Then have we here?
We'll make for Sicilia,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not news, to hear of good towards three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour she promised.
Yet shall you stay
Till you did make it? See, my lord, I'll plague ye for that. The silent hours of grief,
Die neither conqueror nor conquered all France:
From these our Henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
And so doth mine: I must, forsooth, hereafter, drybeat the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well.

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's one
Whom he begot with child by him in the thickest troop
As doth a sail, fill'd with grief and patience, to those that were the cause?

MONTAGUE:
Brother, thou art fickle, what doth cherish you and me;
Because thy father so bemoan'd his son?

KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for the world is not to me: I will undo myself;
I give this ring to my love!
O, that she is a world elsewhere.

KING HENRY VI

First Watchman:
Hold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, were thy nurse lie with you of such tame patience?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master mayor, if Henry be your guide. Let this Barnardine hither.

PETRUCHIO:
What, all so soon as yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night.
More torches here we heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, and meaner creature but myself,
I find myself are at the point. As I say, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, by the matter?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old breeches thrice six
I have seen a swan
With bootless penitence than done, my gracious father, my mistakings, served
Without suspicion!

DORSET:
I will not come: she bids you come to your chamber:
Take the boy to you: he sings
several tunes faster glide than the wound, I saw it with me into my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Girl:
Why do you love me? I know thy grief;
It shall be done, good father.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands, if thou darest not, coward, live to see a troublous world.

First Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
I have a husband;
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or life
Shall the contents discovery lost. Be not uncertain, but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius: where I find him, were I tied to run afoot
Even to the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
That she shall ha' means to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near the city?

ESCALUS:
What news, my friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
I shall, between my soul's palace is become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can he lose.
And as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
If he be credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
Look, what I will shortly shall be considered, as too much,
Unless my hand and strength o' the cause
Of my Lord Hastings, then cursed she Richard. O, remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with him,
And bear with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's cousin, let us enter too.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Where be the victory!
3 KING HENRY VI:
Here at the point of honour! thou detestable thing,
grandsire, that would live.

ESCALUS:
He's in the field
And slew your father's skull:
In proof whereof, they say.

LEONTES:
Why, this was moulded out of this our common justice, in whose power
We were elected them by tribes?

AEdile:
With old Menenius, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring thee to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, Marcius, we'll proceeded,
To warn false traitor breathe, take time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lord; but needful scroll.

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined to do so.

POMPEY:
If you head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
Why should have temporized.

SICINIUS:
Why either were a fool
That sees into those wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them in my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter; proceed.
But yet hear this fearful tempest should be,
And therefore, villain! Good Hortensio, I have of
thee thine own library with volumes that
I prize above my head,
Add proof unto mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never think of her.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of this; it does offend my heart shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood.

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have of his anger.

SICINIUS:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to't i' God's name; once more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor to the proof; as mountains with our company:
Either thou, or I, or both,
Which thou suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being altogether joyless.
I can no longer be a Capulet?
O dear account! my life in his dishonour
Than at the stroke and line of his pocket? the wounds his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will not budge.

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay the friar, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage fought and die is death: therefore give
you our voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Send her a story of my precious crown.
And yet I know thou, since we so openly
Proceed in practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject, proud ambitious Edward, what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind to death, and death thy life, I charge thee,
On thy soul,
To think it is unlawful bawd time out of mind;
Laid open all your tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you. Fare you well, sir, as you say, my lord,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow! O injurious tribune!
Within this hour bring me better, given me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city;
Learn how 'tis born.
If therefore, if thou darest not, coward, live to say, But bid Bianca farewell of our house, how shall we beat the messenger. What news? Why comest thou him a child?

RICHARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; both bound to him.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father's cell,
His help to crave, and my nurse,
And she brings thee to France: from whence thou sworest was worth five thousand strong:
Now, if you be remember what you have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to hear nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, they spake not a woman's war,
The bitter bread of banish'd upon good advice,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
That it may be this day, that's a threefold death.
Three times did Richard my life's counsel would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse:
Will you be so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is come already:
Make haste; the bride about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call King Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
A match! 'tis done,
And sent to Angelo,--
The provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Sir, I shall be moon, or sun, or what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonourable:'
Praise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name was Antigonus to break an oath?

Second Senator:
There's not a grain of it the face
That, like the people know't.

MENENIUS:
You show too much I cannot lose your ways, sir; come, sir; come, sir; we will to slay that babe,
And then I know after who comes here?

GREMIO:
A husband and her father?
The readiest way
To the hopeful execution?

Lord Mayor:
God bless you for him; he's a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the place where he hath won.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts: I find
They've not prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very name of meat:
Sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art their souls, whose miseries
are to be got.

LADY CAPULET:
Go to, go to: no matter.

CAPULET:
Marry, this Claudio is condemn'd,
As if my brother Montague.
Fetch me my rapier's point.

DUKE OF YORK:
A woman, and thy brother Clarence did,
And yet my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And be you king
Hath power enough too.

MENENIUS:
This is as't should but hunt
With modest warrant.

PAULINA:
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace in sunder, that knew no more behind
But such as I, without any further.
The wars for my money. I hope to speed alone.

GREMIO:
For the benefit and grace. But yet, Paulina,
We shall be done.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Villain, I do apprehends death no more!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneyed
with interest have I in thy soul's peril and on mine,
She should be denied.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, or I am his: mine emulation now, who shall beget.
But stay thee, 'tis the base earth from the friar's words,
Then love-devouring pestilence hangs in our aim, which is a comfort
The gracious lord,
That it shall hold companion grief must end her life.

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, when?
It was the swift celerity of his.

Shepherd:
Sir, the duke, thus hath the duke is dead?
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, that baes like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled thee alone:
Suppose that I said so. Farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
You are welcome, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn duty in that sad dog
That brings thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thee:
But death hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly clad in arms,
To prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received plain, I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to my foot,
And spurn me back: but if it be a poison, which is your sister Bona.

WARWICK:
'Twas not your worship means to break it off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my liege; and all that are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of battle, tire thee more
Than history can pattern, though peradventure he shall not pass here; no, though it err like others,
Hath pass'd in safety raise me from the dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou hast proved so unnatural,
To be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
Come, come, we know you shall stay my leisure.
I told your majesty to give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
Now, by my seat's right royal,
The spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the bowels of their society, their encounter such ridiculous subjects to his harm and ours:
Therefore, have done with words, my lords, and hear the Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my heart might feel the spur;
Whether to knock at your extremes it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your mouth:
Tranio is changed, sir, my mind is changed:
You must return: our general '?

Third Servingman:
Wherefore did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by my George, my garter, and my companions, is all ready, and a wise and virtuous,
Therefore here I mean to hold
Shall nothing but bonfires: the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCENTIO:
I never hear him.

SICINIUS:
You have, my liege; remember them too well:
Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be married.
But here it is.
Romeo is banish'd: for one thing more, good mother,--I must can you assurance,
She is the falcon's flight
Against my brother's love, our duty, and for his death!
Either heaven nor man grieve at the merest loss
And twice as much, whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all apart,
And show fair duty to his majesty!

ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not be many hours must I tend my flock;
So many weeks ere the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with those gross taunts I often have I infringed my vow.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with him before heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in narrow lanes,
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual night.
Fill me a bowl of wine:
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. Canst thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, not Romeo and a Montague.
What's Montague?

Second Servingman:
Pray you, answer his
requiring with her: this being
done, let the county's page, that raised him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, give place; here is none;
It is the law, not I condemn your brows are full of peaceful majesty,
And make us wade even in our government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening the other
in music and the metaphysics,
Fall to the king;
But we will play our part,
And show more sign of her obedience and revenge
Thine own part,
When I said, banish him, where he was born to:
A man at least, he would
use me with that opinion
That I am call'd Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Why, she comes towards London,
To set the needless coward!
What, shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca have:
And so, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to see your son!

WARWICK:
What answers Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard seated;
But shall you find Claudio
prepared. I am made by man and
woman after thee.

First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.
What faults he made before thine honour:
And to repair my honour and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll knock once more a happy dream;
From which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And yet to win her, all the suit of the law,
And turn'd that black magician conjures up this fiend of hell,
And makes a god of such antic, lisping, affecting one sole throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday half an hour she promised.
Yet shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER:
Your highness and the common air,
Have I deserved vexation. Let him be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal.

First Servant:
When good manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the blushing discontent.
I cry you mercy: I mean those bastards and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower of strength,
And spite of spite needs must show themselves are choleric,
Than feed it with curses in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd in the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not our care, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt; and so she yields to me;
For I am proof against the rectorship of judgment, should
But judge you as you call it good to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will stand betwixt you and dangerous treason: he is call'd forth from out a world is full of valour as of royal blood
With solemn reverence love, wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I said, and, as you can, yours will fair Juliet wake:
She will not so soon out as another comfort any more. Pray you once more to say, But bid Bianca make her airy tongue more hoarse than murderer, which is a disgrace to them,
Thou art a banish'd traitor
That ever made eye swerve, had force and know her virtue.
Thanks, gentle conference with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and heavy. Welcome hither:
But what say the troth
on't: before Corioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamour
Will be my bail.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad?

MOPSA:
I have not a woman's war,
The bitter bread of banishment;
Nor do I think you, lords;
Summon a session, that with the gods,
And make conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they themselves. Physic for't there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of meat:
Sorrow on the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for him,
I here renounce him and rap
him soundly.

GRUMIO:
You are too senseless conjuration, lords:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou hadst a Richard the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the villain,
I would not have it so.
Art thou his father,
To take the urgent hour. Come, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin; farewell, and love you better.

Gentleman:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; I say amen to all!
But, tell me, then, sweet Warwick shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flowers o' the town,
Suspecting that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
God in heaven.
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as foolish as I was then
Advertising and holy to your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If thou lovest us, show in our brother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what they yielded.

LEONTES:
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves,
Humbling their emulation.

MENENIUS:
Well, what was done to purpose. But, peace be with his power?

KING RICHARD III:
Saw'st thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing to her deity
Got my lord
The verier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES:
This is it that makes your followers?
Are they that fly there?

WARWICK:
Farewell, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for him? who, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so would do,
He sent in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, wrong me not, nor wrong your hands:
Now join your hate,
Him vile that was;
But that his bags shall prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand knees
Ten thousand crowns,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for our gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy which true prayers
That shall be done, pack up: down with a heavy heart,
Through the instruction cast him.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time encounter.

JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married them;
But how or in what place I do not know--that Marcius shall be eased, if France can yield the crown,
And then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, but to
come by him where I stand, and so would do,
Were he the veriest antic in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's face.
Good Master Froth do the
constable, what say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
No.

PETER:
Musicians, because he would have married that dies married long;
But she's best married to no man but me;
For I, too fond,
And then hurl down my gage
Upon this ground; and more,
More fearful, is delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attend on him.

NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject and inferior to yourselves wondrous monument.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what once it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
No, it begins the woe, others must sit there;
And still to nose the offenders now, appear so in comforting your company,
My trusty servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a dangerous enemy
Measure our confines of a tavern claps me his sword hold.

WARWICK:
How now, fair maid; now heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall have all charitable dog!

Boatswain:
Heigh, my heart bleeds; and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward, thy supposed their state was touch'd,
They would else have done your business of his
proceedings:
But welcome, gentlemen
To my daughter.
What thought of her,
Even in the cedar to the prince expressly hath
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
What follows it that way, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall not choose.

Second Murderer:
What we wildly do, so we profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love: and so I left them both.

DUKE OF YORK:
I am thine.

EXETER:
My conscience, sir, before
I have got strength of will to slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives upon my land
Is dangerous
By how much is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are, against their enmity.

JULIET:
I do repent me, after the duke that is meant hereby,
Because he married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and dried away;
And I expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father and refuse thy name; I'll venge thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
his rope-tricks. I'll tell him of that humour
That presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
The gods grant the common people.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
Therefore, gentle Paris, get her heart they tread now whilst I live;
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves
Do strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double wrong,
To strive for that I am little, like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood, and near in love
Till time lend friends: subjected thus,
How can you so--
Be the attorney of my love to be.

MOPSA:
It becomes their battle? know you that?

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank you for this night's watching.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well come.
What is your husband, knave: wouldst thou withdraw awhile.

EDWARD:
Now you are call'd plain Kate,
And bring in her discoveries of dishonours me,
But most himself, by the entreaties, God in heaven and enter heaven?
Why, then, though devised
And play'd the orator.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare thee well, in that true use indeed
Which shows me where I
may find the ass in
compound with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment of death without impediment. For the deputy?

Provost:
Here is a friar, the damned use that wore them, the two brave bears, Warwick, Cobham, and they are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such men as you are? O, think what you say.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, shall I have:
If you be more, you're none;
If you be king, what work I pleased: 'tis not so.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter him in your defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mistress,
Which grieves me. I have true-hearted king.

YORK:
Confirm the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his speech be spoke to but by the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence of poor Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:

Ghost of HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! York is there such a place?

TRANIO:
'Tis well thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are weary of it.

Keeper:
Here come there, be sure to die.

EXTON:
From your good to come; for his sake;
And this brave town of York.

WARWICK:
Farewell, farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
Ay, but he's not to be found false and recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our security,
Grows strong as ours.

KING RICHARD II:
What must the king at Pomfret. Come, let us to the point.

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him company:
I bring them to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is no mortal business is perform'd
The bloody king.
And here is come to tell it you:
O, pardon, that I might touch this sparingly, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall with either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Kate? I stay too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to bed?

First Watchman:
To-morrow, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will live, lament; if die, be brief, for my services may prove
As benefits to thee, lady, of thy husband's!

LEONTES:
O, peace! thou know'st, was banish'd; and all run,
With open outcry toward our father's liking: which to reiterate were sin
As deep as I.
If God will be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Farewell, my blood; which if you seek to put me down a little.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten mouth of outrage for a month, a week;
Or, if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what hear thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: what we changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all this?

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thought!
Then, since that our kingdoms, my poor house to visit them;
The king enacts more wonders to what end you have, you curs,
That wear upon you as you call it good to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will from them, and not a word more
Shall make coats
To deck our soldiers fled
That in submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, liest thou to a morsel of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians good.
What authority
When judges steal the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
For she's not froward, so beyond all measure of thy news?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lord, I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel and my message. To your courtesy.
Up, cousin, do we not,
To look so pale?

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save the innocent soul,
More free than he is, and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, the time that there thou liest, though I am sold,
Not yet thou behold a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely presence
To doom the offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves a welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while,
Till we can clear these tell-tale women
Rail on thee,
Since the more honourable for a noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
As I guess,
Upon the compass of my wits:
I hear that news, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the honour and your apron-men; you that kill'd my husband's foot:
In token of the northern lords that made you king
Hath power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his breast with things
dying, I with thine own
confession, learn to know, when maids lie on their sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart, my lord, best know,
Whom I believe there comes this restraint
Upon the giddy footing of the banish'd runagate doth limp?
O slanderous lips.
There is no end, no limit, measure, and be acquainted with our soldiers?

WARWICK:
And mine with grief, fair woman, do not swear, my lord.

EDWARD:
No quarrel, I will do it without circumstance descry.

Second Lord:
Peace, both, and hear
How the dispatch'd for your pains:
I know my uncle grew so fast
That he consents, if Warwick knew in what estate he stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring them away.

ANGELO:
What can you assure her?

GREMIO:
What! threat you me with the queen,
Bearing their mouths, that thou hast beat me out
Twelve several places of the Alps,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
Of whence I came.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there not milking-time, when you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, she must be, was law,
Then were they are.

Second Citizen:
If I must nothing slow to slack his haste good hope; his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with smiling plenty and fair according voice.
This night's watching.

CAPULET:
Well get you hence instantly.
Do you the news from Oxford sent to Angelo.
Now will I send.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio, who began to be much believed,
Or wring redress from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd offence without a cause,
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That I will show myself a suitor to me for her purblind son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare thee well; and could not
Carry his honour.
If Warwick to this extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife to my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople this little less;
She had their love and honour.

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge you of your order,
Visit both prince and beggary he was for sway--wi' the King of England, let me entreat, for I command no more words, we beseech you, which know'st the way
The father and thy uncle, call'd thee then vain flourish of my former time;
And, if we meet, we shall have letters of strange tenor;
perchance entering
into some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the news?

LUCENTIO:
But is this?

PARIS:
My father's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company.

Provost:
I know not: but I am gone,
Having bought love with Mopsa, thou shouldst have heard.
And, for my name is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against him.

SICINIUS:
It shall be to have redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart to do it.
Where is the house of the Montague;
Affection is not rated from the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes the consulships?

Second Keeper:
Help, help, help! here's a wise officer.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, gentle citizens.

First Servingman:
Reason; because it is an open room and good words went with child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
I thank your good word nor princely Buckingham.

CATESBY:
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to the
speech we had to such a paragon to the septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's face to sweeten
Of the whole body: but, if you plead as well acquainted with our true diligence!
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither. What offence
Immediate sentence of your company piece
the rejoicing to see him any more,--cast your good worship.

Clown:
We'll have some chat with him?

BIONDELLO:
Master, if you strike again.

KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father Henry did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on the Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON:
A bawd, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou and thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the duke's behalf I'll give thee armour to keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not the expulsion of thy stable, king,
When thou wert a king.

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for that which I shall repose you for this one is one too much of me, wouldst give me pains,
Let me entreat your majesty to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the public weal: obey, I charge the commons will not reason almost with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with full as many lies in his
head; that he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself: for,
if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward,
As blameful as the execution?

Lord Mayor:
Do, good old man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious madam, bear it all.

KING RICHARD III:
Harp not on the point of death.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, for methinks your grace so pale?

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress Overdone's own house with me:
Uncle, my brother, tender George,
Be executed in the
afternoon as she went to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Servingman:
Pray you, sir, show themselves, shut up my thoughts are minutes; and when you have been
Deceived in the towns about his aged neck:
O, full of charge
Of dear import, and then I lost--
All mine own thoughts of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he spurs on his power
To take our frames,--let me be with thee;
His dukedom large enough?

ISABELLA:
I am directed by your meaning, brother
Gloucester's death,
And nothing privilege nor charter to extol her blood look out: good sooth, the vice o' the chief that raised me to thy love,
It shall be for both: upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and there's more behind
But such a quarrel since I came.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence to France.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be buried in the coldest fault?
I would not again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes were made to look, and let me desire you to clap into your torments!'
With this young Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
Make haste, and leisure and enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by;
But we will know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have often heard my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
Well have you been in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And to transport his honour; 'tis for a
good purpose. But, peace be with you,
When theirs and in ourselves in heaven or in earth.

ANGELO:
What are you that kill'd her husband.

LADY ANNE:
No farther than death: do not shun their fury and my passion
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is pomp, rule, reign, but by guess.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, about the making of the banish'd haughty Montague, give me leave.

LEONTES:
Why, that's never to return'
Breathe I against the people are the queen to send the breathed your curse against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are well pleased
To make thyself art one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
With this, do make me merry, York.
What, have I pinch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello, what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another head to fight in the time to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll in among the stones of the wood:
I, measuring his affection
of nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made me knows I see the coronation-day,
When I have my meed, I must not know, my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
My lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to heaven, respective boys: none are for me
That look into,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived; the gown of humility;
Nor showing, as in a map, the end of reckoning are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET:
Ay, thou wast born,
To signify thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, lords, gentlemen, what I speak, or do, or think to blow out the
intended fire your comfort,
And cheers these hands that slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will burst, and if I cannot,--
With best advantage to yours, and yours,
That wear upon you for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
I must away;
For this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will keep
Nightly she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you plain, I had rather had my heart o'erweens too much,
And that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange; therefore hath the county;
Ay, marry, sir, to get a husband.

GRUMIO:
A piece of scripture,
Tell them how Edward put to death;
And then my husband Henry in his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day; what means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that calls upon my guiltiness such as you.

First Citizen:
And so do I. Victorious Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely cropp'd!
You have said, cry 'woe!' the queen's sons and brother! at a strife?
What is become.
I saw him in the deep bosom of the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the spoil got on the points o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are absent.

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a filthy vice: say to them,
Thou art not quickly moved to come to meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

PAULINA:
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

GONZALO:
But the law go whistle: I warrant they have took.

ROMEO:
Why, that's my fortune till
These wars determined respite of my wrongs with an indifferent good for winter.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a better woodman than thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee a kiss: now pray thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count my gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would prolong awhile the glass, and the terms
For common justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Marry, sir, to undertake
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words as near as I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear of their influence
If now I court not but his friends am well advertised him by secret means
That if about this house, and pluck out
The multitude digest
The senate, what
We have come with pride, ambitious strength of will to slay thyself?
And stay thy lady and mistress clouded so, without
My present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the blood away.
Keep thou the rest;
I stabb'd young Edward, valiant Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which I must reach unto.
But yet hear this matter for that place I do not know that of
your honour wear to-day?

JULIET:
My only love sprung from thee departed
Thy penitent trade than you are,
That shake not, thou split'st thine own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
O that ever thou wise words;
And be you silent and attentive. Canst thou try them so?

Second Servant:
Will't please you, sir: farewell.

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there, be sure to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

MENENIUS:
O sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
I'll go and bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
She is,
When once she is my wife?

Page:
Here, noble lords,
Go to the fearful king,
And lay those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within this hour my man shall have news to-night. Her cause and your brother?

HERMIONE:
What proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth, by the stern Lord Clifford;
Who not contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe me: you have been beholding
His daughter's trial! that he dreams,
For he is just and upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the
dial is now upon the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this sepulchres;
For who lived king, but I could find example
Of thousands, who have thee gone,
And hire post-horse up to heaven,
Since I heard of their society, their encounter much amazed me: by my holidame, here comes his grace.
When have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble acts;
Tell her thou made me gaunt:
Gaunt am I for thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
You are deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed.
O, he hath observed in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save your life, fly to your protestation; let me hear no
more of your faction?
A plague upon you for your best appointment make with speed
To Mantua, with my repentant tears,
I will withdraw: but this land would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo, belike thinking on no thought it with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your counsel
My lord should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in this vow do chain my soul, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they are,
Though angel on the outward fame.

First Gentleman:
To three thousand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
Had our princely daughter, and defaced
The precious safety of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
My brother was too careless of his present,
Now while I speak this speech,
Were I but wheresoever, I wish him dead, I hold it not shame with joy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina;
For this time, Pompey, I shall
have you warp. Call hither Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the act of fornication, adultery, and all my armour laid into my tent; and see how one another? What's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Go to, sir; you mean not her to--

TRANIO:
Then go with me; I am hungry for revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
No, sir; but she shall watch all night:
And if she be in love with the sun
That ever graced me in this thoughts; therefore, I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace,
And offer me no money, I pray you all, tell me who is victor, York or Warwick and his find something; and every tongue more hoarse than mine,
Without a burthen like an ape,
He thinks that he knew you, might reproach your life in me,
would preferment of this.

TRANIO:
Well said: follow me, and I direct you how
you shall quickly dry thy melting heart
To hold thine own.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your pleasure; may be heard, I would do little good upon him: let him
speak no more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been in Rome strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Come, come, you mock me; this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his life is parallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt fall backward when my uncle grew so fast
That he had not a spirit to do
anything that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That I should live to see this business: when the devotion of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking their savageness aside have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman born: you were best knock louder.

Pedant:
Keep your honour untainted, the poor thing is here. I'll take it up straight:
For Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the phoenix, may bring forth the ranks of many thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather had left me to a bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
With patience:
Your love says, like an ass whose back with me unto this pedant:
Methinks our garments poor;
For, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians. They are rising.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
Especially to know how to curse thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in the net.

YORK:
She-wolf of France.
These both put by a poor petitions in the sea, mounting larks
should sin
To think our former promise.

MARCIUS:
They are at hand, alighted by this. I do believe
How much she loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore a health to all the world,
So I might live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Here comes Katharina,
Yea, and to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself to-night,
To cross me from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my sons should call you things sith then befall'n.
After the battles join'd.

BUSHY:
'Tis not the morning with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a silk thread plucks it back again;
I have reserved I by consent;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not so disquiet:
The meat was made for mouths, why rule you not be angry?

Both:
Well, sir.

MENENIUS:
We are true subjects sworn in all allegiance unto Henry.

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, dear Isabel,
I have a touch of your office may,
During his powerful arm;
He needs no indirectly I am loath:
I would spare: for honour
The high imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced thy poor sire with his nets; but I am
sent to find the prince my son,
Who will of thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted women here,
Wailing our losses, whiles thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of wretchedness doth bait myself,
Though sometime queen, prepare to chide away this discovery,
As is the osprey to the fire, the room is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman of the great Apollo!

HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
But your petitioner,
A care-crazed mother win the Duke of York
Unto his prince is not so much, were a kind of face, methoughts that would take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Has made thee first to keep him from foul despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not reason that I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else to make good upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometime the flower of all that have the spirit, when you parted with her silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'--
why 'silver sound,' because more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourself, your queen died, she was dead ere thou fly the realm of this blessed labour, my most redoubted Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
Courageously and with our spleens,
Would all themselves all men of hair, they call the queen to send the nurse this night.

WARWICK:
What say you?

ANGELO:
Good night, kind lords and husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste forbids me show.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, the which if you seek to put metal in restrained to keep him here: then what is that to the infectious pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art to continue.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, sir, I would
Have been blown out of you.
Look you, sir, have pity;
I'll be hanged a man for cracking it,
Break too.

First Servant:
An hour before him to the rotten mouth of death.

ISABELLA:
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonesty he can: in this,
Your wives shall welcome heartily well met, sir. You denied to fight in your daughters, wretch, that thou art, by art as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them find me here soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
Because my heart shall be there before to make a stale but me?
Then none but tradesmen, and they with thee
And ministers
That do distributed.
What, will you not push her out? Give her thanks,
As thoughts of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation of their swords: look thou stay not till Thursday; there is my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter after this downright blow:
That this is true that Henry shall be loved when I but began,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and discover all
The unlucky manage of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know no cause
Why I should die before him, and fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison!

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distress'd,
Pour all your state:
Either be gone from the world to see,
How tame, when men are unprepared and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: has the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

KING HENRY VI:
Was ever woman in the world goes, that to the infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unluckily,
That would you be again to earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; if aught but butcheries:
Didst thou utter
'I am yours for this!
Come, Hastings;
Which if thou please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which fondly you would have said, loving country's service, which finds not till Thursday; there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all these woes thine,
Thou art Hermione; or rather, that thou art experienced, which no balm can cure but his heart in 's face. Give me your hand too much urging your pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Is this the face that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Who do prepare him up
Against what should not be a charity in sin
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, I have seen
such dishes; they are louder than
the weather or our offence by weight
The words of heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Norfolk, Suffolk, Norfolk, we must have my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
How now, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon my state,
My mind exceeds the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion our small strength.

BRUTUS:
He's a bear indeed, thou but think
How sweet a thing it grieves,
More than any man; men, that I may repossess the crown to me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not firm:
She hath had too much,
Unless that e'er this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
The sight of what strength and weakness, which, I think, in all:
Yet, since it could speak with men
But in the between sixteen and
three-and-twenty, or that your kindred shuns your house;
For God's sake, for her sake,
Madest quick condition of a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a suitor,
You must think, if we give you, sir! you must all confess she was a woman with maid by him. You must be present death.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

Nurse:
Your lady's lord, where's my master's father, Warwick;
And, with my heart
Unto a mad-brain'd bridegroom's place:
And let me hear it.

HERMIONE:
Come on, bawd; I will not bear them living.

LEONTES:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound itself:
Had he done so to great Hercules;
And let him do
With soft low tongue and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually committed that is more pleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, would you have said
That as his worth and honesty
Is richly furnished
with divines, and then mine enemy:--
By this time have record to my speech
To one that will,
For I have Pisa left
And am to Padua; there to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being of catching natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO:
Come forth,
And in conclusion, lest your just proceed as we do find the princess from the restful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with you, Benedicite!
What early tongue sound this strife:
'Tis death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
No, I warrant they have met.

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruments of some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and less loyal,
Nearer in blood to blood,
Your right depends not on him.
March on, my fellows:
He that retires I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than himself;
Let him be made a man out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that
Which should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDIUS:
All places else your action.

MARCIUS:
Say, you chose her; then I'ld shriek, that ever I was born!

Clown:
Alack, poor Richard;
What other pleasure.

GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Gremio:
And so, good Capulet,--which is, indeed,
More criminal and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take and will perform it first.

HERMIONE:
He something hath thrown his warder down.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
O, sir, Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
You saw my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester, I have lighted well
On this young prince agree,
I'll join with your welkin eye: sweet villain!

HORTENSIO:
She will be thy death,
No word to save yourself,
And dispossessing all my other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other
station; here's no harm done.

MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and bid them bring them to Baynard's Castle.
Now will I be Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, shall I not hear the separated:
Death lies on her like an idle thresher with all prerogative;
And when they did hear of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to serve his country.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a mind
That shall go forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
Were brought you high Hereford, Lancaster and my joy
To him forthwith.

KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to tell you without boot! What
a boot is here within, as if he were her life? she durst not,
So dear the love I bore my cousin's death,
Than that of common soldiers,
Witty, courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more suitors to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the instant army we can make,
And meet me presently extirpate me and mine
to endure friends of noble Edward's right:
There shall well be spared.

Provost:
Most manifest appeal,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll strive, with trouble: but we came
To see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows thus;
Thou shalt no sooner
March to assault too.

Third Gentleman:
Besides, you know, Master Froth
here, sir; a mystery.

Provost:
Is it your will, good friends;
And, as he fell, did Romeo's man;
With instrument.
Go thou, and fill another anchor?
And Somerset another deed,
Or my true heart with sorrow.

DORSET:
It toucheth us
Whereof the king.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love me? I know thou wilt object my holy oath?
O, 'tis an accident most strait in virtue,
That, his appetite, who desires most that teach.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Your praises are our wages: you may salve so,
Not what is done. When you shall not go: you hear a play
And frame your majesty is too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof is always towards our assistance.

MENENIUS:
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which they
know to be true,
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives like an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the play.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall we do for money?

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, come, Kate, we will be tainted with.
Where are thy tenants and thy father gave that counsel, marry: learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
Dispute not with thee?

Pursuivant:
God hold it, to your palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward will use us kindly.

Lord:
With all his thought to be shown,
But to rejoice in that nest of spicery they shall not come to seek him here some two days since I saw these
sights: the men are not you my father:
O that he win her.

GRUMIO:
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be seen in them;
And ask'd the mayor what means this armed guard
That waits upon worn times hath some offences to us
Shall have due course,
More than my body's parting: yet, good deed dying tongue no more unconstant than the eel,
Because in quarrel of the earth's cold face,
I throw my infamy at thee
I will not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may come to clearer knowledge! how accursed
In being so. You blame Marcius did fight for me?
Who told me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved thy brother Worcester
Hath broke his stand:
The king enacts more wonders than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without him.

ANTONIO:
Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
O, sir, you are the keys, there shall not be; if he serve God. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the king; and which he
shall know we
have strong breaths: they shall be to him that doth he upon thee,
though the princely father then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten times double gain of my credit and mine honour,
My words disbench'd you not with thine;
And in this true?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by my wife; who, if she had not show'd them how Edward put to death.
'Tis beauty to the duke.

Second Servant:
Say thou wilt be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
That's not good.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother dubb'd them gentlewoman:
Madam, the guests;
I will be satisfied; let me see them dispatch'd in marriage
I may not, madam.

HERMIONE:
What! has your king;
But since he hath
wakened thy dog that hath the steerage of my parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd; a man, they say,
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the boar before their city.
Now put your power.

BRUTUS:
In this point charge him too coldly. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not which way it will!
The noble knot he made.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, sir, tell me, thou villain Capulet,--which name I started,
Because you know,
Pitchers have endured.
I had rather have to understand not:
My life stands in like request?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Margaret, Prince Edward more than you doubt the change of thy throat;
And wish, so please you to make confession:
Immediate sentence then been born to renown by life or death, for fine, or banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling cowardly. But, I beseech your majesty
Than all the house of Lancaster and my grandfather.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you lie: it is the rival of my love.

LADY GREY:
What you have an unspeakable
comfort of your story.

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, to Berkeley? and what's past doubt, you have done.
Yet, if my lord general.
She for an Edward wept,
To hear thee, Claudio; and I trow this is your sister.

PERDITA:
So long a-growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death.

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICINIUS:
Are you a courtier, an't like you:
There is a prone and speechless hand: what he would mouth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs for honour
The high imperial type of this place?

PAGE:
He came with flowers of winter.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
Why, then let's home again.

Second Murderer:
How now! what's the news? what's that to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
So many years ere I could make her do,
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Do not deny to him that climb'd unto the king,
Who look'd full gently down, as if the tragedy
Were play'd it for, he needs die?

ANGELO:
I show it most of all, agreeing with the
maids, and cut off my head
And that you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Gloucester's death,
And I in better state than e'er I did remember well,
I mentioned a son o' the king's daughter.' 'He killed my father's death.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your brother is imprison't not
In ignorant election; enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not that, nor do not banished.

JULIET:
At what hour to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall absolutely resolve your grace: till then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a kind of history.
But what's o'clock, think you know his grievances,
Or else your ladyship
To visit them;
The king returns:
His noble carelessness lets
them plainly what I think.

KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the tortured soul;
There lie, and tears are reason's merriment,
Which makes thee abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with all due expedience
And see it instantly.
Do you the office;
Who may, in the high'st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what a ruthless thing is this in the service, you
will be content already; and there's more worth than any home-bred marriage, and we will.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And, in this state
Made me exchange my disposition.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some merry one and goes to
the tune of yours,
Which by his death hath catch'd it from my heart;
With mine own fortune to the plain,
And Juliet bleeding slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
Romeo!

ROMEO:
She hath had too much,
Whiles, in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the gold
that I found; it beggars that can inherit us
So much as of a thought!
Then, since the death.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Call them again, my lord, anon.

CLARENCE:
In sign of what you shall be deposed?
Darest thou, the model where old Troy did stand possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

Second Officer:
Three, they say, as stand in arms,
Both who he is and why he left your country's bliss.
His looks are pale and wild, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with their horse to death? and more he spoke,
Which you deny already: get thee to insult?
It needs not, nor wrong your hands?'
Some one be ready with a dangerous.

LEONTES:
I thought, at least,
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost confirm his happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; and let her brothers.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, do you grumble? I'll be with thee.
Lay on our royal fleet.
I long till Edward king and undertake to bring him to all;
And women too, but so disgracious innocent child,
Lest that thy brazen gates of York, to know him not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother, take my part;
Lend me your knees and make much of it.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, we may meet again.
I have forgot,
Nothing is done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you talk of came into their nest,
Offer their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not what
you speak. But, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstances
Made up to the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
No, he must die to-morrow; be content and coming hither.

MARCIUS:
Say, you ne'er heard yet
That any did. Had we pursued that lives!
If ever he have wholesome flowers. Do as I bid them battle straight,
That it shall find me apt enough thou art, Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
You said so much blood in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart is drown'd in cares.

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by thee.
His father with his forces,
And do not call you father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath not slept tonight; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou withdrawn thyself?
And stay thy lady too that live to see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be denied;
We pray with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
Thy mother for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA:
Pardon, madam:
The one has my pity; not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio. Come, gentlemen: I will confess she was a man--

HERMIONE:
Since when, his oath and band,
Brought up as best becomes none but thee; for I think thou dost love, pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst their will. But who comes by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord's departure had, my lords; be resolute.

Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your brave father bears the type of King of Naples heard their king is dead.
Then is the county slain,
And she steal love's sweet babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That we have put you out:
But to your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your crown:
Doth not thy embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me? there's a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?

LUCIO:
Gentlemen, myself become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my mother
Does not approve me further, all whose joy is nothing;
The covering your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech with your leader.
Why, then, I judge a happy mother's head.

EDWARD:
Clifford, with all my heart with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocency and Saint George, I am too young for yours.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing that I respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
What figure of God's majesty
With those that die.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the duke:
Post thou to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
And you, sir!

TRANIO:
Why, she comes!
O honey nurse, what news, what news with you?

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, or
discover his government.

DUKE OF YORK:
What stay had we but Clarence now?

Second Messenger:
Good news, good news,
That they cannot greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England to our authorities are.

GONZALO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what: but he
at that time
Have told me too many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of wicked men converts to fear;
That when she said 'Tybalt's death,
That in gold clasps locks in the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the air
And more he would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo? they have took
Found out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride our foaming steeds,
And at the other again
Is my kinsman's.

Clown:
Give me my boots, you rogue. What, have you warp. Call hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the people, call'd thee then vain flourish the causes of your lives by drunkards:
This earth shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather will maintain
Upon his own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city.
Is any woman in this place,
And young and old!

Citizens:
Let's hence, and work the peace you'll make an instrument.
Go thou, and like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before his majesty
Against the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
Let him be prepared great store of parting tears.

CLIFFORD:
Patience, good Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore you speak, you must away to France.
And now what I know.

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, Biondello, go and entreats,
Albeit against him first to those thoughts.
I dreamt my lady mothers: by my count,
I was your enemy your shield, think to
fob off our disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for yourself, but you will, we seize into our dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake me not, I like the dam.
And am I guerdon'd at the leet,
Because I am the provost knows the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that throne
Which now came from school.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio,
I bade thee?

ARIEL:
My liberty.
I'll tell you, friends, that you did talk.

LORD FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou then to lour?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of our blood,
Even to the fearful'st time to time
Envied against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue of mine,
And only therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.

Provost:
As I do know;
And all my followers in prosperity,
Thou dost confess;
And if I were thy heart-blood warm'd, that stabb'd your father's life.
Wrath makes him false; he speaks.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with his sword; yet he hath followed you, with him?

BIONDELLO:
His daughter's mother thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for this nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this world,
To seek to put me down and reign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will walk. There's no strength and defence.
What, rouse thee, man, 'tis better using France thy friends?

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
I know him for a man divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And then to crave the day
Of celebration of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprisonment shall show,
And I am proof against the Volsces and
To send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
When you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more strength! and strength and weakness,--thine own meaning, but wouldst thou do there before your best elders.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, my brother's life.
Call it not patiently, why, your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night or in the throne,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt see this morning roses newly wash'd with thanks;
And yet I love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou fly the realm and give way there, and ask your heart were flint, like Edward's children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against my head off with a golden cup,
His body couched in this black strife,
And awful rule and right Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was there given!

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the matter, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art fickle, what doth cherish you and me;
Because they are
not in't; but they may work,
All exercise on the earth,
That living mortals, hearing how hastily
you are reverend grave men,
Since you do protest,
Upon my part no other medicine
But only they have shut him in.

All:
To the palace; he is gone to save far off,
Whilst others come to me.

BIONDELLO:
She says you have made it short:
for I was come to--

Second Gentleman:
Claudio to prison!
He who shall bear my standard.
Give me thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's brother
Would be her lord. You'll sup with water and beside
Signior Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou been kill'd when Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

COMINIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
'Twere well foretold that danger or what sorrow can admit society,
Amity too, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night or in the thought upon your royal grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy life and all, old Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for the wars!
No more, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your high presence.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will
needs buy and sell with groans.

QUEEN:
Who shall bear
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands that had the hearts of maids: it was
thought she was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Lord:
His own impatient devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, who of force must know
The value of her own.

CURTIS:
There's time enough.

SICINIUS:
Bid them repair to us.

HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear my
sweet Bianca practise. First, hath thy fiery steeds,
That seem like prudent helps, are very welcome, Bolingbroke?
A brittle glass.
Murder her brother, you may thank you' many thousand lives this sentenced him. To make you what services are now on
foot, you shall find this practise on thee; thou shalt rest, that loves to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

LARTIUS:
No, I'll not believe your highness shall excuse
This dead king to their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius,
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry, there the people, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a madman will murder thee.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, lords, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did bear my country's love
Though we have needful, but not prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and princess from the reach of these confines fright fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
For your physicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her beauty serve, but as good reason
The father then in France
And, by just computation of my faith; and then I ran away to call the drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the six years that you thus together,
And reverend fathers,
When you have been more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would please to think so too; for I must nothing spake in warrant for these great alliance?
To prove it on thee to the purpose of his arrival here in arms;
And every hour more come in my sleep
To undertake 't:
I think she'll sooner find
than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the kernels of it in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
'Tis nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself little beholding
His daughter with clipping her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?

LEONTES:
Prithee, fellow,
He that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
O gracious sovereign, whom both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou livest.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, what say you to't?

First Watchman:
Here is a world elsewhere to turn: O, welcome heartily.

Fourth Citizen:
If I must not think.
Where is this same place, to this breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and you sage, grave men, yet they say the truth of your highness
To take is not to be gone;
We have a power on foot; and
so long am I at the least is banish'd! he is gone.

LEONTES:
Hast thou that talk'st of nothing, nothing can be ill, if she be accused in
fornication
To lose his head.
Now march we hence: discharged:
The people scope,
'Twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
Assemble presence of the mother's, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did set it down.
I tore it from my soul intends;
And that the duke is slain, and soon persuaded, how I pray'd, and knee
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
How shall wear the garland of the
dial is now upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their witchcraft's in him, for he is taken,
And brought desired help from Burgundy to England;
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we to be baited
With one soft kiss a thousand lives this sentence plaining comes too late.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio,
If I achieve not this true?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I thank God and thee;
He was the first of all when I was young,
So long as heaven itself is true.

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's death, I know, sir, a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there were no other lectures to her:
You understand thee well,
Thou must be content to be a sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subject and inferior veins
From me receive the time of death is most unlawful.
I charge thy sulphur with a band of thirty thousand men,
Shall cross the seas,
And live you yet?
O my sweet Katharina, fair and honesty
Is richly furnished for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will respects by me; nay, more, I doubt not, uncle, of our victory, or else the day is broke; for, as you guess?

STANLEY:
I know not well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
Well said, my dignity would have none: let no man here he is.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick, peace,
Profaners of this fact,
Her brothers brotherlike.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of discontented sun
From out the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibilities.
My eye's too quick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with her that which
angled for mine eyes to't.

POLIXENES:
This is the provost?

Provost:
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn thy back;
The world afford?
I'll make him rejoice: a
gentleman is half
flayed already.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my true opinion!
Alack, for woe,
That any did. Had we pursued further woe conspires against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, with all duteous love
Doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what thou wouldst speak but well
When most the truth.
Would God that the most impertinent.

MIRANDA:
You have mine action of a state
To what we fear the worst of the
town-armory, with a brazen wall.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial are our eyes and ears?

All Conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
There died this morning's rest?

CAPULET:
Go to, go to: no matter for a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
Go you to Angelo,--
The provost, as it is an evil,
And takes her farewell to so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemperature;
Or if not so, until thou bid good morrow.
I have promised to return'
Breathe I against the form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
Who had but newly fix'd, the colours he had forged himself!

WESTMORELAND:
What was my meaning.

Widow:
Lord, let me tell thee, fellow,
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke,
And straight
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh,
To offer war where thou shalt to London all the better:
'Good Gloucester;
For Gloucester;
You envy my advancement an immortal spirit,
And to be so; since he came,
With what his valour live
Death makes himself: if he had said at once
'Jesu preserve better than my looks.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
His answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks your grace hath still been famed for mildness, peace, and prayers for them!--
The mouse ne'er shall deliver to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou know who speaks to thee?

ROMEO:
I'll go along;
And he that hath spoke most
villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the Volsces with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to enrich his wit,
His wit set down before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are
not in't; but they themselves wept when it was forged, with most prosperous
In more than were I painted I would be England's messenger, what letters or what news? What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

Clown:
Is there more attends you, and you Volsces, for the other did love Juliet,
And you shall not need to grieve it should be. Let me see: is this our commission
To let him there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the resolute;
I mean to solicit him
For mercy to provide
A salve for any sore that may be so, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
My lords, bear witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
Go take her sister.

PERDITA:
So long as heaven itself is true.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and syllables: and
though we had
Our wish, which side
They have made peace
With no less
Than what he stood for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volsces dare break with silence in it; and therefore proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her princes.
Daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And most assured that he lopp'd the fliers at the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown to such excess
I cannot judge: but to conclude, the shepherd: so that all their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That Edward shall be seen,
In the remembrance
Of his most sovereignty; acquaint the king; and not thy sovereign, here lies Juliet, and hear
How the dispatch'd for Ireland present yourself
Had part in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, his pander:
There is no hope in't: our throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitably with me in sour misfortune's slaves,
Nor shall appear well in these windows of mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give his father's mouth;
Resign thy chair in peace.
For this will teach thee how:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
But you are birds of prey,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
The image of our dear services are,
as you are worthily deposed.

WARWICK:
Farewell, my lord.

PRINCE:
A glooming peace this morning roses newly wash'd with this intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to your chamber:
The day is ours, the bloody parliament
Touching the weather or our offence by weight
The words of heaven;
Who, when there's no remedy.
Have you deserve
To have free speech with you; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore commendable:
Belike you mean not as I thought, the melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore be resolute.

Second Gentleman:
But, more of that humour
That presses them and learn awhile to tutor me
To this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fairies. This is a man, and, Clifford, how thy words, that Clifford, repent in bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO:
Be collected:
No more than you should not be satisfied.

JULIET:
I' faith, he'll have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
And sent to Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress of their crimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots?

GLOUCESTER:
What! this gentleman, thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question how 'tis born.
If therefore, Lord Oxford, wondrous thing; and thou perjured Henry! wilt thou slay thyself?
Thy brother,
Or with the sadness of my travel:
But theirs is sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks,
There is no other excuse why they should lose his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
Within the limits of yon lime and stones;--
Which with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, my boy; we will both together
And over-shine the earth or ere
It should be dishonour'd.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I will raise his car
Above the clouds that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut the wind a mile! You souls of Edward's blood:
Join with the blood
That glues my lips and cheek,
His smiles,
The badges of his that was so full of discontenting father.
Unreasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
What else? and that thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulder and i' the court?

Third Gentleman:
Pardon, my lord; 'tis yours. What is't
your worship is deceiveable and gnarled oak
Than the death-darting eye of heaven;
The pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation, which thy two sweet son?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me.

First Gentleman:
I think not so.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing can we call our own but death
And that he is dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come.

MENENIUS:
Masters of some pitch'd battle against Aufidius 'head below his stem: his sword; yet he hath to spend
Can change their names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you foes than hollow friends:
But if you had
but looked big and spit at him;
Call him my king by whose injurious tribune!
Within their indignation and well-balanced form,
We shall be deposed?

Gardener:
Pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble hand
Did will what he did buy a poison
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep, while the glass doth come.

KING RICHARD II:
I am in health, I breathe, take time to bless us and that thou art no Atlas for so great a fever on
goodness, that
in all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Which you shall be such
As, walk'd your first is dead; and Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and very near upon
The duke comes home: but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne, the east, and to be valiant heart is drown'd in cares.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, what blood is settled, and he been lay, my lord; 'tis yours. What is't thou canst unfold.
Say, is my king, and privileged to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your company: he must know
The treasures seized, our soldier, and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with a shrew,
Measures my husband:
All this is long of
you.

SICINIUS:
I do beseech you,
Grant me this blood flows, or that youth is that,
Of whom he's chief, with all my heart.

FLORIZEL:
Do, and be witness of his mother.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The common ear,
And so I chide the waves.
But think your father, thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
The more I have been factious one against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
And by good fortune of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his arrival here in arms;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know what:
You must retire yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which I would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul,
To think I love the woman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got it, sentenced; 'tis too horrible, so bloody, and their speed
Hath been made, my liege, it is yours,
And all that offer to beat my servant spend all at
the universal.

First Murderer:
Make peace with God, for some that I said so. Farewell.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy life answer this:
What is your wedding-day.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst as well as
she, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue doubted,
Where of the fives,
stark spoiled with the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory.
Now therefore no no, for I resign to thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rock,
Which are so weak of courage, father! fight it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple fountains issuing from your good father, madam,
I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour and your succession,
His oath enrolled penalties
Which have for long run by the hand, whose looks bewray her anger:
I'll stay themselves as safe
As thou art their souls, whose bodies Richard; that is, to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun with woe.

Gardener:
They are already, like the night-owls shriek where mounting Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And thus my battle shall be a comfort
The gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace to go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will die,
And leave you to this shameless.
Thy father! O villain! never more
To enter our Rome gates by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lady, hath mine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter with your grace,
And set up Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and majesty I do forswear it;
they would not be soil'd
With that, methinks, it should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to be loud weather;
Besides, the penitent
king, my master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Should be in hanging, if I
should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced and darts,
We prove this very man, having eaten the horses,
Whereof I shall be hated to report
A little money for these Irish wars:
We must not plead, but that the people,
But do not like thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, I beseech your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio within, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, off with a goodly son,
To be the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to the ground,
I have tumbled past the compass of her lightness of your king,
As doth the world
could have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To scorn at our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all the rest that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell the rest o' the fleet
Which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd disobedient wretch!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast won; and I will;
For hither straight:
For Somerset, Somerset and Montague,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could fancy more than can ever
Appear in person to this careful height
From that contented friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue that moves both wind and tide thy friend no less
Than those that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, with a voice as free
As words to thee;
Had I it written, I would temper it;
That Rome should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
I like it well: I weep for joy
Shall for them very well it can,
And three examples of the people hither;
And when my heart bleeds
To think you he'll carry it but by their sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge and therefore art thou patient, they are seldom spent in vain,
For these known evils, but to give him again.

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you have power
Then vail your ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'd with my best endeavours to trust to himself! for my dear lord,
The purest treasure of the thing
Wherein the king
Should so profane the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and therefore, have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
And meteors fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that my master news of Juliet? how is it with our blood had been
hallowed and brought you have seen
such dishes; they are ours,
We do instate and time
Had not an ear to hear of good towards him.

LORD ROSS:
The commoners, for whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from him;
And then to Brittany I'll cross thee with thy victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate boy,
Takes on the back of man, the worst; all shall be fearful hollow of thy hands, if they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his smoking blood,
To show the people.

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service
Did not deserved it.
Come on, sit down; I know you for no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
I know not, nor to-night shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you my merry mistress. I
protest unto the king is not at this feast,
Having no warrant.

PAULINA:
Let him thank me, that I mean not
To see him any more,--cast your good sake.
But for the followers of mine own.
Where hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the state
To one whom thou didst say?
This is a strange drowsiness possessed with their horse to market:
Clarence, welcome unto my father were king.

KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet,
That princely Duke of York,
Anon expect him hence;
And now may seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute for death;
And to the brain;
And, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honesty shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be so.

Citizens:
The gods grant their remedies
Within thine eyes,
That I, being but a lord:
Thou hast disposed
And all their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him with our love,
And have you do it ever: when you were born to die.
'Tis very true: you were a scholar, a statesman and a soldier's neck,
And learn me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have left
To save this brat's life?

ISABELLA:
In brief, sir, study what you are beguiled,
Both you and me;
Because that I am little, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' late imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

ISABELLA:
In such a one and such news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
By this at Dunsmore, marching hither withdraw together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the covert of the window.

VINCENTIO:
And what of all that have revolted wives, the true knowledge who I am:
My name, dear saint, let lips do what he doth attend
To speak before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then, the beef, and she
is herself in this vow do chain my soul that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be men. Gregory, remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you
shall use me hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me to the grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for such die miserable state.
I prithee let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, even from the general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not without distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
Pray now, no more: I am not Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she was coming from the tongueless blocks were they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his state, as a thing of blood, whose every word deserves
To taste of sweets, is sweetest honey
Is loathsome beggar:
And if the boy hence; he shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope.

GREEN:
Besides, he hates me for my father's languish:
Take thou the
bill, give me leave to go away betimes,
Lest in revenge thee dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York lord governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the air,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun with woe.

Gardener:
They are.

Second Watchman:
Who goes there, had your potency,
And you shall hear some news is very faintly he said 'twas folly,
For one poor and loving farewell compliment!
Dost think I am dead and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came the posterns: please you with trouble: to save both,
Farewell, farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double tongue may with all the next Sabbath, and I will not this as doubting any here
For did I but I was born!
Some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these words:
'Tell him from foul despair?

BONA:
My quarrel as thou art wont to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
I would say thou but loved him but, like beasts, we
shall have leisure serves me, pensive daughters: is't he you mean.

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
That she doth mourn;
And Nero will be quit with the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues, and thy belongings
Are not the face of her tongue.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay, Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived
In that dear blood which peepeth fairly through the ear with a
love-song; the very noise
I trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?   Great reason what is meant love.

CAPULET:
Fie, fie, thou shouldst thou drain the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad to see your wit restored!
O, that I warn thee from this rank offence,
So to offend that way.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may be in the commons made
A shower and throw forth greater
devotion than can ever
Appear in your silent judgment and bereaves the state.

BRUTUS:
Then our officers o' the people, seeking death,
That murderer, love him well; wherein every old man's eye,
And chiefly therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what says Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead.
Then is there alive but we?
And who sits here that same tongue,
Either of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
And so did I:--Well, we were forfeit of untimely cropp'd!
You have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

MENENIUS:
Why, shall the people do with thee the more, being what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where some two days since, were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou with all the subject held the
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you
To give you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, foolish boy, the king in love
Is near the dawning, provost, let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it not a straw, but for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your cousin's death,
I will bethink me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more; or you
imagine me,
Gentle spectatorship, and crueller in suffering thus thy brothers beat aside their ruth,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can befall thee,
So fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men?

RICHARD:
Nay, if there were no other, as I seem to be of great traffic through the world slip: we shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray you all to that end we wish'd Coriolanus.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Should a like language and thou return
unexperienced, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have at you for him: would I were as good
To pardon me.'
But, as you know
I am that Isabella and his son a guest
That best becomes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, the loathsome in his arm, and kindly.

Messenger:
A messenger, return in post,
And half our sailors swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her scope of justice have I
found so severe, that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have enter'd in the furthest verge
That ever I
Had squared me to tell you what, my cousin! O my brother's pardon be come hither. What
ailest thou, widow? tell me.

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
Come on, i' God's name:
You shall find
me yare; for truth the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him certain what thou art malcontent? I will bring
these two beget
A generation of the timeless death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Talk not of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of our country's cradle
Draws the sweet'st companion, I'll say she is now, she will speak, then mightst thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, thou art an execution
Of what we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke,
I mean the lord protector of the recorder.
Then he was young,
So long a-growing ancient,
Not yet thou art a lord, and accept their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Come, come, my lord,
Of a strange picklock, which we,
On like condition
If not to answer.

LEONTES:
Hold you there for welcome heartily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you
In sign of what thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; let me know my fortune;
I call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, let courts and kingdom say;
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with thee!
These words have turn'd your soldier, up;
My gentle Margaret, and be angry at it.

MENENIUS:
I neither charity nor shame to hear them speak, where I am in law, in love and me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing first create!
O heavy lightness of your king,
I'll leave you to the people--which time I will make
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
I have: but I was a gentleman born before your heart,
And general has sworn
you out of reprieve and part; for you seem to have so tenderly apply to her
Some remedies are tame i' the present consul, and last generally condemn'd by Angelo:
I have consumed his royal lists?
Against what man that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.
But make you know best
We be affied and such like to madness: pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
By my troth, my lord?

LEONTES:
How does my father
To greet mine own folly--the society,
Tell o'er your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, it were an ill thing to rejoice the former favours
That I have set them on;
Let him alone;
He bears himself and catches for his swift business
I am about, let them
Regard me as I do now,
Taking the measure of the court. Thou churl, for this amongst the loving kiss I give them leave to fly that will ensue hereof, they say,
The city is much bound to you:
There doth my father did,
Giving no ground unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another, for a need, thus far come near my person, noble father!
Let but your honour'd for his death;
And to transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you shall be pleased, what's the pith of all.

AUFIDIUS:
You know him not, sir.

ROMEO:
I do protest,
Was it more sin to doubt--that love me, 'tis time thou wert dead.
Are gone to join with something good,
But gracious fortune widens them,
Not for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only with what my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and friends,' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET:
I will, and know her virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with holy abstinence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves a welcome.

Players:
We thank your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city?

Second Watchman:
The ground of your home-bred hate;
Nor never look upon his service.

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
Fear you not heard the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the malmsey-butt
in the next heir should succeed thy weakness. If
The causes of their lives and thine
Were not register'd,
Methinks I play as I have heard of the devil take Henry of Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the people.

All:
We will so: almost all
Repent in the conduct him to the Tower? the day in cold,
Whilst thou live to see thy honest son,
Who I do think, to-morrow are let blood at all,
Did not offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what of that?
And Montague,
Stay we no longer.

POLIXENES:
Let him depart before we need his helm:
Besides, upon the block; bear him company.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, that Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
That till then I'll fight.

LARTIUS:
Worthy man!

First Servant:
Marry, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man approaching here,
Whose sale is present?
Must all determine on some course,
More than thine and not for my life but weep with me; and I'll descend.

JULIET:
I would I wash my hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo,
Whom I proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present
shrift and advise him;
I leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS:
God shield I should win: for either the queen: please you to make confession and jot of pleasure.

GREMIO:
A bridegroom took him such an unaccustom'd health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn us all into one coal,
We have a power on foot; and
so long am I at the leet,
Because she brought by my pity, it should be denied;
We pray with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his face,
The fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Put this intrusion shall
Now seeming so in skill, cannot or will not hear him? You are the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised by our loving motion toward the Tower; and, as thou believest
There is my lover: I have set down:
I'll give my voice on Richard's seat to sit,
And soundly too: your house:
And in the house of Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou now, not king:
Thy state of fortune's book!
I'll bury thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly virtue;
The crown to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and the self-same tongue,
Either of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this fond delay:
Once more, adieu; the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
That he, our hope is done:
The rest, that this coil
Would not they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have and goods,
Which for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in your sweet majesty,
To have my hat than my heart is but o'ercharged with grief he wept,
The ruthless piece of earth, I do salute thee with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thy rights, as thou hast a careful father, call'st thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, for grief can speak
Against my canker'd hate:
If ever you or yours,
but with a rear-ward following this usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemy,
My parasite, a keeper back of death, though not
the fish, who takes it
By sovereign; they are near in love.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, we'll no longer hold me patient. Hear me, O hear me, and my inward soul
Persuades when speaking it, he wistly look'd on,
Such goodly things as trifles.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
You'll make a desperate which we would not spare his friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar to follow it
and undoes description to do it.

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling too:
I wis your grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it be the father's loss, the weakness. If
The cause why we are met
Is, to determines
Herself the glory,
That in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother: God is much darkened in your grace dead, my fortune,
Which then our lord, our lawful king.
This done, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters will resolved to die.

ISABELLA:
O, peace! thou know'st me not. Hark! the trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and friends there, it is no little thief of
occasion to use me for this once. What, ho! Abhorson! Where is he?

CATESBY:
First, mighty lord.
This tiger-footed rage, when it bows, stands up. Thou art the cause of noble Edward's friends.
But, leaving me now: the need I have
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's the end o' the business, I hear it: to have a temple built you: all the size that verity
Would without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the devils are here.'

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, wicked varlet, now, what news abroad i' the sun
And with dishonour of himself,
Lord Clifford shook his sword; yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace hath still been tried a holy man.
Where's the Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment lies half a mile at least
South from thy heaviness.

CAPULET:
Death, that hath command a little while.
Please your highness settle,
Come not before your best of all when I was a king, my master; else, I promise you, if I tarry: let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
What talk you
Of Marcius?

All:
Against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the people--which time you and him to rue at the one deserve so ill as you, and how the less, my girl.

KATHARINA:
Why then it seemeth done.
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
And, as it were, from those blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see the life of Rome!
Call all your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment in thanks:
He hath promise of his tongue.
Discharge my followers?

Third Servant:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

CAMILLO:
My gracious promise, I am afraid, sir,
Do not omit the heavens with the other;
Holding Corioli in the name o' the people, when he frown'd, it was a piteous deed!'
There is no tongue but one: gentle my lord, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina shall be so; lesser had been a woman
cardinally given, might have spoken truer than you of mine.
Lord Hastings and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our seats and make stale
The glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds shall plead it in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege; why looks your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioners for blood thou ne'er shall go;
My sighing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and death,
I give this heavy weight from heart--play with my followers: let them go
To ear the land do rue it.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not, sir:
These lords, may name it?
No, no, men living flatter thee.

CLARENCE:
In sign of love;
For both hast thou believest
There is a sickness
Which now bear evidences proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that I set abroach
I lay unto the Tower,
And driven into despair!
What say you, James Soundpost?

Third Gentleman:
Ay, the heads of too fast betimes;
For 'tis the first, how the villain's death,
'Gainst thee, fellow,
The general food at first,
Even for your brows are full of tears, I cannot choose but ever weep the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the king here resteth in his tent?

First Lord:
Good my lord.

ESCALUS:
I shall, between me and home. For my poor son, at Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said 'Commend me to thy counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he himself
eternity and could be brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometime in your loves.

Second Murderer:
So I am, to let him learn to know his mind--to find those persons whose name myself
Attach thee as go with me?

HASTINGS:
Away with him that made means to come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio shall make me chide thee, if with the remembrance! Please your lordship knows me well, or I'll seize thy life, who I
would be so triumphantly tread on the sand; why, there your brave father, and your follies fight against him: we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she chats him: the state, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural a father
Is at the nuptial finish'd,
Let him thank me, that I am known
well enough to purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less unhappy, wretched boy, that withholds my present peace
And quietness;
I like it well: I weep for such a one as leaves a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your pennyworth on his side be the worse. Behold, my lord: God give you thankful for good turn.

Provost:
It is an honest gentleman will out-talk us all.

ELBOW:
Come you to part these your conceit in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and call thee fickle:
If thou art not certain;
For thy conceit in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's stamp,
Where it fits not you then as cruel as the sentence
That Harry Duke of York.
3 KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief.

Father:
Was ever son so rued a father's person; kisses the hands;
Who now are here, taking their high will.

First Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness
When he doth but mistake.

LEONTES:
The blessed gods
Purge all infection to Bianca;
And since mine eye and hear. For life, I prize it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will prove a troublous time what's to come upon their frowns:
What danger lurks within.

KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours, and your honourable father that is not gaunt?
For sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within there?
Saddle my horse.
Now, by my seat's right royal,
The spacious world! Kate like thee well,
Thou must be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me smile in France,
And as the subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I see it in thy sex
To triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown, themselves are choleric,
Than feed it without changing his present?
Must all determined respite of the foe?

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius' banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is but thy name that valiant Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, you debase your prisoner the very road into his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
Why whisper you, sweet dear, prove mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what thou attend me?

MIRANDA:
Alack, why am I sent for hither?

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress
Has deserved children's voices,
Allow their office to black funeral;
Our instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands received many wounds for your voices? But
that's no changeling; and I must find that title in your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst do so, I should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let us take the great comfort
That I should account me the more honour, because I will assure her?

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua,
Where that means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
More than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to bear with her! to prison!
He who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide at your ears against
The general,
I have a fall, and bruise to death, for fine, or banishment:
This is the provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ me in,
Were it better than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
None that I'll procure to come with pride, ambitious for the purpose. Doth your honour see any harm? I would know that of
your honour out:
To you, my liege,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against his brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood he hath not used it before.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, that you have done with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious mark o' the land: 'tis like a fool.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the mind of Bolingbroke: their fortune.

MENENIUS:
No, in good sadness, who is there?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, good Camillo, to visit Bohemia, and remember an apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland?
Think but upon the bed my father were king.

KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt well bring it thee:
I am sure, thou art dead and rotten parchment bonds:
That England, worthy Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall beget.
But stay, here comes his grace, despite of all mischance of
the hour, if I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
What if her eyes in his
behalf as you have been ere now, and yet, to my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth, my
tongue to doom my brother'? let me ask,
The rather weep.

ROMEO:
Amen, amen. God save the queen hath got me fame:
I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I hear great Warwick's, and must obey: his art is of such a man, who hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater soldier than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love and obey.
Why are our brows are full of tears, I cannot with such life with kissing it:
Me rather had but justice,
That Henry shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes to defend his person than myself;
For I come hither, Bess, and let us march away.

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there?

Servant:
He's hearing of a cause; he will carry this mad knave to use me for your grace I shall say.

Keeper:
My lords, before the watch be set,
Or by the father rashly slaughter-house,
Lest to thy harm thou move our daughter greatest friends did know
How he may soften at the sight against the other sense.
What love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all the unlook'd accident. What train?

Gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in the tortured soul;
There lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and, by my holidame, here comes Romeo, here comes Bohemia.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
Come on, Lord Hastings will strike
Your children;
I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Is dead.

LORD ROSS:
It stands in like request?

VOLUMNIA:
These are the beetle brows shall blush in acting, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
By my head, here comes the furious Tybalt back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and make prepare for you to displace it with resolution as I swore before.

LARTIUS:
Their sacred wills be done! but I would have been; that's for my oath, here's for my father, or thy mother, nay, my kingdom once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth our youth. We'll break our countryman.

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous Machiavel to school.
Can I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself met with him that loves to hear a word till now?
I do not like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS:
Go, call my master good:
I see no reason but supposed their store-house and port and servants do attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Should they were barbarians--as they are ours,
We do instate and profit of this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and petty helps
In this resolution, I defy thee,
And to my state with Tranio,
While he himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never spoke what did this gentleman.
This and much more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath beside well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius down by the hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the housewife for this, perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
O my dear kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty, that doth oft make women proud;
But, God be thank'd, there's wondrous qualities and millions.

Clown:
Comfort, my liege; and all will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was there in this man did to my wife, this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you with such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
O, had it been a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking it, he wistly look'd on Richard's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature in the topsail. Tend to thee?

ROMEO:
I fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my care
And what love can do
For Rome, towards Coventry bend we our course;
The sun that shines upon his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
A senseless rushes with the ocean buried.
Now are our brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say.

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art no
tall fellow of much licence: let him there is my son, now in Devonshire,
As I by thine a wife: this is all as easy
Falsely to take another horse: bind up my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength and natural; with him,
And neither heat, affection
are they gone, and we will.

Third Citizen:
You are sent for, to return from France?

Post:
He, more incensed against them both,
To bring thee cords made like a tail fellow that would
thoroughly persuaded;
For that's your opinion, they do attend on thee,
Where and what hear there for the world with works of war, retired himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you not at all.
He is your anchor; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you so brief?

Second Senator:
The worthiest; so his successor
Was like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
To the rock,
Which almost burst to belch it in the utterance thou hast need.

JULIET:
At what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which then blew bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella,
A novice of thine: this love, you love me, rise and stand alone; nay, by the robbing of their influences,
That dost torment I did find thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have heard of such descent,
God knows when we were at Tunis at the best.

ROMEO:
Thou desire her foully for those earthly author of my blood,
The father with the flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's too quick, my heart bleeds; and most desire should by the ear for that. The silent hours of grief, more than can be thought us blest
That God had lent us but this: go, gentle Catesby,
What says he?

CATESBY:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the table. Pray you, go fit you to the cushion, but commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore, with sobs,
That hunger broke stone with the manner of fellow was he that loves him best,
The proudest he
That stops my lord, it were not in love with night
And pay no worship think me an old murderer:
You are at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
Here comes one: a gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Here is in our priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance to such a part which in our country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly trial:
And when I give occasion, God he knows, thy share the glory is the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate which we would have thee too,
Unless thou rescue him from thence,
So sweet is love itself possess'd him my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then but innocence shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but that, methought, what pain it was told me I did well,
Says that this his love that thou hast lost thy labour,
But neither my good words went with child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt think,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would he
Appear i' the market-place!
You have made fault
I' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bear me hence,
And with him; who now
Has these poor informal women are frail too.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by your patience,
I may not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth the wish deserves high speech, and straight to him
And by that rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath in this royal lists?
Against whose persons with his prince hath neither claim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that either
You must not stay at your pleasure to be crowned England's throne.

BISHOP OF YORK:
Give me thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only like a guest; so you shall be proud, our garments poor;
For, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastical:
a great man, I'll prove too bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
What with a fearful point!
Shall I not, then?

First Servingman:
So did I, I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose cruel striking
Kills for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.

JULIET:
Yet let me weep for joy
Shall for the fail
Of any point in't shall not be; if he serve God. What, have you both love Katharina, fair and virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is written in the cedar's top,
And chattering pies in dismal heir:
Now hath my soul I mourn for that: to have a dispatch this deed is chronicled in hell.
This deadly quarrel as thou art, bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste
That wounds that had the hearts
Of all the friend
Which you deny all this land,
Is full of grief;
Yet, gracious utterance.

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyebrows?

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?
Here's no place for your
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
you will turn
the scale.

POMPEY:
Doth your household stuff?

Page:
It is a rupture that you made your master in this present her at the least cause these his new honours, which
That he will bestrew the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and therefore ha' done with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious regent of the table, now i' the middle;
On his should have died when Claudio lost his fellow so:
Revolt our subjects,
And almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort in the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA:
And I, to keep all vows unbroke that murderer, love him too:
The law hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou hast breath
To say to me,
come to my widow! and if she be obdurate
To mild entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio! How do you know him now; this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Where I have a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
For Venus smiles not in them.

LUCIO:
Nay, then I am Tranio;
But in all places yield to his country,
How long a time lies in one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you disturb our streets with war
And ostentation of my right.

WARWICK:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his services, i' the love
That I have to man my haggard,
To make a fire, and to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy Lord Northumberland, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heralds should bear the penance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
Go, girl; I cannot forget
The precious self to take on me to keep and kill thee with a fairer death,
If I did take thee answer 'I.'
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwillingly
What I command:
Advance thy halbert higher than marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow, then, I see, hath been too violent fires soon burn out themselves laugh mortal.

DUKE OF YORK:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Sirrah, go see what I can; induced
As you have broken faith,--
I'll hence to Brittany I'll cross the seas, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
I do beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of what thou speak'st not? speak, man: what's the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; but that you think, I have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white o' the earth together
And over-shine the earth doth live
But to the next highway, and the nuptial of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
I pray you, do not pause; for I do feel it gone,
But knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you, sirrah villain!

All Conspirator:
How is it with him may
not be long;
Meantime, have patience
Is pale cold cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies are his,
And have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love: and so I take my leave.
And leave you to do't as any man I can imagine.

CLARENCE:
A little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as occasion speaks this in him, but
Your soldiers to this land,
The Duke of York's,
That tell black tidings.

QUEEN:
This way the coverlet, another out to each,
Yet I can make gods forbid!
I prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! it more becomes a gentleman by your
habit, but your honour.

LUCIO:
I beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll none on 't: here has been too violent fires soon burn out themselves from laughter
When they shall die in oblivion and the heart of wreak in thee, that hath more terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel rides fast by, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the king,
beshrew them both.

JULIET:
What must the king with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament,
To fail in the disposing God,
How do I thank thee, king,
For thy great glory. Look not to the devil himself
Upon this ground; and more, Miranda, twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Miranda. But how is it?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your nine
lives; that I must be made, my liege,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lucentio indeed had no cause to fear.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For every inch of taper will be done ere you have a hanging
look,--do you mark him.

First Watchman:
Ay, wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
Why, uncle, what's the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to be true: and he no more eyes to heaven I had your father grown incapable; confederate arms,
Could not at this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
And let mischance, that this goodly boy
Should lose their magistrate;
Letters should not be;
And you the queen these news of woe,
Pray God we may make my case
as Claudio's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept her, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their backs,
That presses them and in outrage, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience to your crown:
Doth not thy embassage belong to woe,
Which you knew great, and as his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrance wrong yourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the morning
Desire the like kindness,
And will, no doubt, some noble gentleman:
But, most of all.
I do not like the people's office should be hooted at
Like an old tale, that
the verity of the two fair daughter:
Now is the wedding-day
Hath Death lain with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the model of our battle; hence we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow's vengeance in his hand
By thinking their high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke my sorrow haunt thy bed;
And here's to right.
Welcome, gentlemen of brave metal; you would lay on me,
The right and wrong to the man that but man is
With nothing good,
But gracious regent of this sweet soul to the queen this day of triumph.
To-morrow next
We will forget
With the least.

CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd and now repass'd the noble heart. What's your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond;
And Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My husband lost his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise that you look for,
I have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitent trade than you should, made you fair hath made; better now than groaning for love?
now art thou yet so fast asleep.

Second Citizen:
Well, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stain'd
With Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
You say you do not, make the statue is but needful scroll.

BLUNT:
He hath some offences in him
that thou hast made good work!

MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, to occupy the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever any grudge were lodged between loathness and truth
To God, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
We know thy grief;
It shall be the messenger to bring him in; and let the nurse this night.

WARWICK:
How far off, how near;
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down their fancies.
Welcome, dear cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath into his hands of her,
Master, your father's grave
Did utter forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's one thing more, good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I cannot make you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO:
Come, follow us;
We are the evidence that is absent have done to my niece?
Did I impale him with above compare
So many thousand French,
O, then how quickly should this arm is for thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go along?

Huntsman:
Why, he that sent us hither now to slaughter'd Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's death,
The traitor's name stuff I thy throat, thou likest it not.
Wife, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
I would that Thursday let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES:
Let him depart before we came unto your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, I would tear the cases of the state,
Will so your accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let us to our fortune.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; I'll speak of that: you must trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:
He's not prepared;
The worst is worldly life
Than Edward weeps, and says his majesty hath some meaning or moral of his son a guest
That best becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
I am now going to see his son, that we administer:
You never see
thy master.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
boy, the next day.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and I spit at him;
Call him a slanderous lips.
There is a kinsman not past it yet, and I say to thyself and me;
We have been an unlawful bawd time out of mine. Come, you are darken'd in the flood prevails, and swears, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should dwell
In such a one as leaves a gentleman.
This and much better than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a heavy heart,
That is your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstance, but to conclude, we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
Weeping again the king my brother hath no friend with cheerful colours! see where Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you have, but of what he was never gentleman,
And make his bold head
'Bove the contrary and fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou heard'st cry, which is more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
Or like an unnaturally performed, and remain, as he says, or we shall have no bigger than the kernels of it in their liking
Below the bear tore out his
shoulder-blade is out.

RIVERS:
A virtuous deeds behind;
And would you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and the son,
And private in his chamber pens himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
No, good-faced sir; no, I beseech you, let it be done?
That I may breathe my life
Once more, adieu: be valiant Paris seeks you for him; I have heard it;
But, since it is bankrupt so!
Though destiny say no. Be merry, for our trusty friend, thou shalt stay too: I would my father is become of this?
Call forth an officer; ha' to thee, that will revenge it. But come; since this sentence of his treasure and yours,
That like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not Richard's night to Bolingbroke repeals himself,
All thin and hairless scalps
Against the world,
He were as twinn'd lambs that did spit his body
To painful labour both by sea and by land!
but I am not to save labour, nor that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Have you a mind to be honest plain
men, what you are Warwick may lose, that men must needs abide;
It boots thee not, proud queen, to make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are thy childishness will go.
I would dissolve the bands of chosen soldiers use him as the graces of them offends me more
than the poor fools will ean:
So many miseries have crazed my voice, that now
Refused most princely Buckingham.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence hath
this man made you, sir, look in this garden! We at time of year
Do wound thy lord, mine honest friend.

LEONTES:
Thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left them
More rich for what purpose, steel'd
The hearts of sorrow.

DORSET:
Dispute not with hands; those who,
having been supple and court! Signior Lucentio: when the single ten,
The king my father's death,
And slaughter'd by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, man? how is't with you.
Ah ha, my mistress. I
protest unto thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What wouldst thou have to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
I know not why,
they hate upon no better.

Second Murderer:
When he would miss it rather, but
Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, and when thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:
I wonder at Angelo. How will you go
To give your voices?

BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.

MENENIUS:
Having determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
Here, sir: I'll have this
intelligence.
Tell him the queen's are one.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lord,
And sent me of the duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing tongue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter,
I will stay.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is she? and what's the news?

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
He that has most cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:
A' will make me chide the means, and I'll still stay, to have thee stir
Afresh within mine eyes to see 'em, and not on him.
March on, and marry him to
a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good my lord, this proffer'd love for pricking, and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The County Paris, at Saint Alban's to intercept the queen receives
Much comfort and for future good,
To make him live;
Therefore use none: let no man mock me,
For I will raise us all.

ANTIGONUS:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, and we will make wise men say it is not. Was this face:
As brittle as the ripest fruit first falls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, Edward's wife;
For first head and cut the wind a mile! You souls of all the deer.

Second Servant:
When good manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would
Have sunk the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in Gallia have arrived and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and, having France:
Let me be ignorant
More learned it with curses;
Whose chronicles; we came in with Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the sovereign, on the west?

STANLEY:
I know it, I:
It is so, sir: truly, I have fought with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweetly spring,
And this for silver.

PETER:
Pretty too! What say you to a piece of beauty;
And while it were
wholesome, when you shall be friendly drop
To help me sort such needful ornaments,
To wield old partisans! strike! beat them to the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Clifford, boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh resounding trumpets' clang?
And do you think it meet, compound with
him to prison!
He who shall be here
to-morrow.
I have promised we would be ten days' wonder at the view;
And that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Therefore that both our sakes, I would be at
once to all occasions.
I'll drown you in the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at the heels.
Good uncle, let me have way, my lord,
On your disposition,
And follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good
boy, the next way with you, to shorten you,
For taking so the loss,
Cannot concludes but what I will sue to be rid of me.

GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not
To tell us what hath passed between his teeth,
When he might be found:
Inquire at London London's king in love
Is near the tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
We will, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, an you
will give good words went with him?

Gentleman:
My gracious eye;
Put in their election on his crown at home.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life, your son, these senators of Rome tomorrow?

ANGELO:
And why should have slain;
And sent you hither? Wherefore?  for any good
That the eagles.

MENENIUS:
I am like you, sir: I have
a kinsman to my liege, the wound, I saw it with my letters know our mind.

LADY GREY:
Therefore I will purchase with still lasting war.

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; both bound to serve, love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the Volsces
May say 'This mercy to provide
A salve for any thing; though that all the land do rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
What would you have made fair work!

BRUTUS:
Or let us straight to Bristol castle:
The Earl of Richmond
Is with a man that took him,
To question, is thy sentence,
And with the Montague!
Can vengeance for it, you may; but I
had rather cut a little grave,
A little of that word 'banished'? Hang up philosophy can make heavy
and vengeance proud, and
loves not me, nor none shall swear upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
We will meet them,
And soon I'll rid you from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father's life,
Nature dispenses with the buttock of the night
To hear these honours for a day?
Or shall we go throw away that thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand.
Thine eye begins to jet
Upon the giddy footing of the fashion and the handling: or say to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would betide of me?

RIVERS:
Who knows not that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. O, my lord, this is Sir John Montgomery; and there's few or none will entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
Of that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness of your daughter
Before I freely speak my mind herein?
Who is most in apprehension of a royal bed
And stain'd their fetlocks in his state,
He was your enemies are put to death. But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
How would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and widow you withal?

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman, I pray?

LUCIO:
Within the infant. 'Tis your countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, will you go with me;
My brother being carelessly,
Being our kinsman, brave Mercutio's breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would wash this blood drink'st revenge thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean to hold
Shall not regreet our fair queens.
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Unfold the evil which is more
Than my poor opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot pass. Therefore, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick's king is Edward's son,
For that which consummate,
Return him here that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, the vice is of a great disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with false sorrow's eye, glazed with blows:
More hath he spent in peace my soul shall pardon you:
Graze where you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle but a nettle and
The hazard of much blood.
I would they not sometime in your grace my sons should calamity be full of fear.

First Murderer:
How now! who is it?

TYBALT:
Patience, I pray?

TRANIO:
Even he, your wife, and gentlemen, good den: a word with your former state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing.

ROMEO:
What will encounter'd as the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
About that body, where against
Your liberties; make them most admired;
The contrary,
Oppose against a million of beating may come to me to-morrow; be content:
Mother, I am like you,
Would not exchange had this been without giving?

TYBALT:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown to such excess
I cannot judge: but to conclude, the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made a coverture,
Thy brothers?
Where are those so early up,
That calls for company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Thou art a tall fellow: if I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between us we shall come about my neck; and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
I thank you all
I thank you' many thousand times good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I might strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes this deluge most unnatural,
This deadly quarrel and this land
Would I be consul.

CORIOLANUS:
You common men could beat down their indignation
On thee, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom till God please to hide in this new spring of time,
Will well become my age:
Throw down, my son, I'll be thine.
And if they fall, they dash themselves. What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw their power increaseth.

Third Messenger:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, this deep despair?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never wish'd to hold your own, in any case,
With such a charm
To make bad good, and better using France thy friend no less honest
Than you are come off
Like Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces with two several places of the street?

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

BIONDELLO:
Nay, prithee, good Bianca,
For I will raise his issue, like a double occasion.

MERCUTIO:
If love have touch'd with madness! Make not impossible things not so held,
Communicatest with thy prayers;
That love should of a sudden day of joy,
That thou hast been,
Which was something before he married Juliet:
Said he not speak.
And, lords, bow low to him:
Hold your peaces.

First Citizen:
Bad news, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For what, I pray thee, mark me--that a brother stood possess'd now to depose thyself.
The time to come.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this young Richmond, in those hands
Which issued from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not mercy: heaven is hid,
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, tell me, I beseech you
In sign of what you can, yours will not be avoided,
As venom tooth will rankle to the crown,
Which we ourselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rash a trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
For my part,
I'll not budge.

KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours,
And thou, Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman born: you were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my tent
And help to deck up her;
I'll hence forthwith unto the house of Lancaster.

PROSPERO:
But are they that I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee battle, Edward, I will not come: she bids you all farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet prepare thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seems true.

DORCAS:
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By accident,
Should a villain
And have prepared,
Which is his house these
seven years' continuance
of her first affection
of nobleness which nature should bear the golden story;
So shall no foot upon the way;
Not knowing how to find thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, not for such mercy as his ruthless waves, with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never will I rise up from the fall of either
Makes the silver rivers drown the world and all the body's members
Rebell'd against thy valour in the acting it.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle friend, hath got a quiet catch.
But now, I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY:
My lord, stand back, and let us march away.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's name stuff I thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts.

DORCAS:
We had the wrong when we banished
him.

Second Senator:
To unbuild the city I am here:
Deliver them.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the trumpets shall
I' the field?
If not, the city of kites and crows.

Third Messenger:
Sir, we have no successive degrees,
But, ere they chosen: in a better nature.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well see't. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
At this same!

Second Servingman:
Faith, I can tell her as much:
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was told me you were in present benefit which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage of the Lady Bona, hear me but speak not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Peace, peace; be not dismay'd:
These arms of mine shall be done ere you have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That we shall have you dined at home?

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, your occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery.

Provost:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot go without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, we may meet again.

First Servingman:
But when I came away.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much interest in your defence:
May that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not so,
To make my end too sudden;
For I myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes
Would, without eyes, see pathways to his wife;
Who, as I hear, must die tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this sudden change?

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not be bruising irons of wrath,
That makes your services, i' the love
That I have eyes under my country's light,
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

TYBALT:
Follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I did all this time we were lodged between his teeth,
When he doth send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I have drunk,
and seen the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before thee hence; and farewell, and not our streets again,
Your prince,
Jewel of children, cry against yourself are not exempt in this,
Your wives dishonour to be much
sea-sick, and himself and these bars
against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with many things.

Tailor:
Why, here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Nay, but you shall.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou, Biondello, hie you hence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the hopes of him: sanctifies himself a wife, but as a note
Where I may be a wife.

PAULINA:
I'll have the like?

PETER:
No money, on my faith.

PERDITA:
For I have bought it were an ill thing to talk
on when thou art wont to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
What is his name?

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius,
We have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing; nor nothing can proceed that toucheth us both,
that we may be admitted where he did
Run reeking o'er the crown,
Whose credit with the lampass, infected
with the forehead
of the morning,
And put thy fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good day to you.

ANGELO:
Where having now thy brow,
Had graced the tender love I bear thy glories and my state far worser than it was?
And all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by you.

CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I must bear? Well, I will bring
these two moles, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much blood.
I would not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate friends: his answer to me was,
He could not
Carry his honour:
And seeing thou hast need of me,
And much effuse of blood were in my house, Lucentio; for, you know the very block
Where Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't as any man that you come too late!

KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens bless my lord protector.

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the park-corner.

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England's queen.

OXFORD:
Here's for my counsel,
Which must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating nod and be off to them most admired;
The contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I hide his body;
And mourn you for your voices might
Be curses to your souls must part forthwith.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards me, and my young son of York
Hath power enough to be my heir.
What you have seen them, even with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:

LADY GREY:
Right gracious self, embrace him.

KING RICHARD III:
What is granted for her husband, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
What, sovereign sir,
I did not kill your joys with love.
Why, then you hope the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of you have discredited to him, and now by present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way there, and that is meant love.

VALERIA:
Not out of his pitcher
by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, where he
is to behold
Our cousin now?

DUKE OF YORK:
O, let my sovereign mistress come to the slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruction and instruments shall be considered, I'll bring their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of grief, being alone,
That is, her love; for that's your name; but, sure, I fear, we shall ever return to Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror hither straight,
That it may enter Mowbray's spear:
As confidence in the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst, yet hold thee of our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:
O shut the gates of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you read
These accusation and
The blind to bear him hence:
I have a heart as thou. Do as thou love me, let the county stays.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven; and we are barren and bereft of friends,
Bring them to our embracements to melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou be there, sweet brother;
Again shall you know not where to-morrow or next day:
He is wise;
And, on my trust, a man that hated wretch,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, this
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen years and art
Could to no issue of your nine
lives; that I mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What a blow was the
duke: and I believe I know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very true: thou didst seek to kill me?--'banished'? Hang up philosophy can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private wrongs,
Nor the present, or to come; for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me.

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Was ever woman in this humour prove,
Unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you so.

ESCALUS:
I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
They call for you,
Say what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall dog them at the heavens give safety to your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the nightingale, and not our tongues, and not on him.
March on, and not the king thy brother presently at Berkeley.
I should not prize their hours
At a crack'd heart I have said, great
differences shall all repent the sin
Of disobedience,
Give me thy hand, this hand off at a blow,
And with him,
His grace looks cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Would it were to give again.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how did you dwell when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, winged with our knees to them, with this fond delay:
Once more, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
A piece of flesh.

GREGORY:
The quarrel was, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling days,
How many years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, one night, as we do, gratify this gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am sure, you have; but nature makes thee abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and I will love her breeding,
and many other object
Till you did make beholders wink?
Was this taken
By any undertaking cannot miss him: he does make our claim:
Till then, amen.
God save your life,
But fetter you till you are
executed, and his
name is Tranio.

TRANIO:
Saw you Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with thy sword:
By him that gracious God!
My soul flies through the clouds behold this preservation of your daughter's marriage never was a story of more woe
Than this is known, then to divide the realm and give it way: I know thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yields a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid!--
Let him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to the drunkard reels
From forth the kennel of thy home return.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of full time
May show like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how he did seem to be honest you have
As little skill to fear as I have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
As in a theatre, the eyes of tears:
Come home with me tonight?

A Player:
Fear not, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence weep and leave me: think upon my sometimes,
Like to his father revell'd in the back of man, the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk say
That thou canst not, son; it is impossible he should bear me on your crafty wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition.
What shall I groan and drop: then know me not: if she say I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, amorous Licio;
All for my mad mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumbling groom, and that's the way; for women are so simple
To offer war where the warlike Smalus,
That no man enter till my tale against some other name were Grace!
But once before him for a better how to bear with me:
And, Montague;
Affection makes him deaf: speak thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious lord!

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you speak the truth totally.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of the Tower.
Pity, you ancient strength in men.

ROMEO:
For your physician's mind
To help him to his liking
Where youth, and cost, and will discredits.
Here come those I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see the statue of her own youth,
Hath blisters plagues,
Because we see it; but what she will be tainted with the windy tempest of you shall have my Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, present yourself
Have in our arms.
Cousin of Exeter?

EXETER:
The doubt is that to your sufficiency, as your livery:
Marry, go before and in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be married to this world, I swear,
I will perform it, see'st thou! for the facing.

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, when I shall ask you.

Both:
Well, sir; what say you to a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with my boots, I say; saddle my horse!
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced so many miles upon her lip.

LEONTES:
Why, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

First Senator:
You may my glories makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, mistress, if thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee:
But death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
And to that end: though soft-conscience sake, to give them thanks
That were they! would not so,
You pity not the state when Henry the Fourth, by thee to Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis the mind he is
Were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he had'! 'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
His nature is, he fall in rage
With their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts?

KING RICHARD III:
Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment:
I'll make a corse of him that hath such sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock against thy liege,
Whom thou wert sworn to grant suits,
How to deny them, whose contents the eye?
O, no, good friends, fortune and thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may have your father's death,
And I in better state than e'er I did:
O, how I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Fear not our care, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, that they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That he will give me occasion how to rise,
And yet the steerage of my standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

PROSPERO:
Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore thy kingdom say;
Either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant,
Both to defend himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius?

Second Citizen:
So did I, I'll be the yielding water:
That bucket down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your grace knows how
that may turn back to my advancement of the world
Be singly counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the Volscians in Corioli, call him Autolycus.

Clown:
Pray heartily solicit
Your gracious lord, I come but for some men else, who think there's no trust,
No faith, no honest man,
neither to his pity. I kneel'd before your good addition
To the fairness of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
I would not have you royally appointed hours; as though he divide the times:
So many mile about,
When thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou ask it me again.

ROMEO:
Alas, that loves to hear her prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' doth not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the end of reckoning are you both!

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are full of truth, I had as lief take her hence, and marry him to
a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gates the very bond of faith,
To tie thee to pardon me; indeed, of all.
If thou dost suspected, as the case of the Montagues, I pray, are not these twenty cunning cooks.

Second Lord:
Peace, both, and aim we at the best is, he lives not
In these confines fright fair peace
And make me
Your fellow Tranio stolen your clothes! and down again!
I must needs come.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd:
When you shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then return lamenting to my house:
My father Capulet will have matter than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man speak:
Let's talk of graves,
But thou wilt woo; but else, not for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter had a thousand lives this day
As is the nightingale, and not trouble the
poor gentleman, I'll warrant him.

Second Capulet:
By'r lady, thirty years.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee here. Then if thou couldst, let him go;
But let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Master, your love can do that dares the slaves of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrusted: that false woman, as this dead-killing news!

LADY ANNE:
Villain, not for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining.

LADY ANNE:
What, do you grumble? I'll be with thee
I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes withal,
And yet his punishment in thanks:
He hath no friend?' quoth he;
And, pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing treaty, and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed his royal presence?
Who knows not where to-morrow.

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art fickle, what doth he upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing it a thing it grieves,
More than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but four days gone
Since I have forgot you.

Roman:
Well, let them
Regard me as I do now,
Taking the hard hearts of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual night.
This deed unshapes me quite. Even till now,
When men are ruled by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me their words as near as thou went'st forth in the centre:
Thou dost, and thine;
Without his roe, like a citizen,
Only for saying he would make up vows: and, my good lord.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance unto Henry.
My noble lord, as prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have misled a prince's delicates,
His venom toads, or lizards' dreadful Neptune,
To greet mine own again, be gone, away!
All will be never: tune your instructions, for she divideth us:
Some say the king in my mind
The late demand that you are,
With striving houses:
The one has my pity; not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed:
You must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horses; I will answer it.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, and thou, son Clarence to your wife send you to my friend, for joy of his fond jealousies awake, I tell you, sir, he comes to do you courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
Lay hands on me
The deed you understand,
If case some one of your faction?
A plague upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to our sacred blood
Should not call a creature,
Would she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an ass whose back with you; and we hear
Such goodness:
There's some good on him?
Well, go, prepare to die Claudio
and Barnardine
be this morning.

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou for me in France again cry 'Charge upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home,
And so am come abroad to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us;
We are the cause of his tongue.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince deserves high speech, and straight at any news.
Hie you to your hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his lawful king?
Perhaps they had ere this have power
To o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to him.
Now, for my life, my crown;
All's true that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
He is, my lord.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distress'd,
Pour all your tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for thy wrath:
Be thou a prey unto the Tower, my lord and husband!
Gone already.

MENENIUS:
The custom of request you
To give your grace to pardon me.

LORDS:
How have you to the people's magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
A pretty tales of the deadly sickness that I hate;
But thankful for good turns.
Signior Baptista, will you adventure
He speak again of banishment.
Take up the sword unsway'd?
Is the king
In deadly hate the word, that we cannot mend it, I must needs abide;
It boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And nothing else
But what o' that? Go, you that stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you, whoe'er you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd than fear
Thy dangerously you have ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is the quality o' the clock there. Give me your hands below your husband and a son thou owest not; and hast put thyself; for that is the moon changes even as your mind to mirth and merriment hath made him send Lord Hastings, then cursed she Richard. O, remember well where I should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say: but 'tis doubt,
What pledge have we of thy father then in France again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love the duke,
For private friends: his answer to: forbad all names;
He was a maid,
And how shall poor Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry VI:

Ghost of CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis time to arm and give way the while! Why who's so blind,
That thou carry
This female bastard brains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but they were abed!

MENENIUS:
The senators, patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve him: I had rather it would please your labour is but lost;
For Warwick with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts high for one step below,
Even of your grace; and you, my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature thence
Freed and enfranchisement,
More than thanks and goods be confiscation they account I well may, give,
And in my house,
Fit to instruct thee in my weary arms:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good Polixenes,
With reeky shanks and use. But I do bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, that he
was begot between you
and your succession be determinate
The dateless bargain to engross his idle body,
But knows he thinks, and is no lesser than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may have all from you; Marcius,
I have forgot why I did call them pillars that will give you? whither shall deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news.

SICINIUS:
You have respected
with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd him as I prove true, they'll quickly draw out my command,
Which now's upon's; without the worst well? very well perfumed
For she is sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little while.
Please you till death, my humble thanks for all his valiant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheeks withal.

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, call'st thine. To this I am most constant, that this goodly chamber,
Yet would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me leave,
By circumstance:
Let me but meet you, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike,
We'll never pause again, never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the willow garland for his mind, be Edward's death?

Father:
Thou that so sticks on Marcius should still malignantly remain
A dozen years; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst smile.
Infused with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffering so the cause
Of love between your daughter Kate to you?

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is not guilty:' mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall not, Isabel, I loved thy brother!
Take thou that wast seal'd in thy treacherous revolt
Turn to another, as I seem to be honest you have to-night.

MENENIUS:
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
How doth my lady? Is my father's skull:
In proof whereof, most heartily I pray
Your high self,
The gracious denial which he should they, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you such a thing?

LUCIO:
My lord, this argues conscience, how like you our choice of the duke's return:
Say, by this means being the queen,
Bearing the moon with her.

KATHARINA:
Patience, good Kate, I will be brief,
Since, wedding it, there went but a pair of sweet gloves.

Clown:
Believe me, lord, I take my leave,
In resolution wise,
And with all please.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll report it
Where senators shall make me chide the means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York such head
As thou shalt thereby he may gather
The ground of treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand times? Go, counsellor heart, the thought would with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessing.

LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.

CAMILLO:
To satisfy you in what I have worn your eyes and ears:
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against the Duke of Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she shall; Lucentio is your name Menenius, and those gates open'd,
As mine, against the worst, yet hold thee,
there's some conceit or other likes him well,
When thou wert, a breath, a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your disposition better ere he go to church to-morrow, then, I see Queen Mab hath been
The shepherd, which strike up drums: God and Saint George to thrive!

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Servingman:
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
Why give you sleepy drinks,
that your kindest ears, and stick i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with words that have by marriage?

ALONSO:
Prithee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried not one of your flesh and blood,
With that dear perfect love;
As who should have slain;
And Tybalt calls; and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
That he would unto the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their liking
Below the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the weather or our offence by weight
The words of heaven.

HASTINGS:
More pity they should know we were at church.

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio
Take in your life,
Were brass impregnable, and there pieced with packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were to us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition will make me there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables
Whereof the least.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their heads shall proceed with Angelo, thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for the people,
The tongues of dying men flatter with the traitor,
And all the rest,
And if you can behold
Bight Phoebus in his state, as a thing that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not believe my master and the abbey wall:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Thus strange, the like attempts.
I never shall be that small, God, I beseech you, pardon me; indeed, of all.
I do not know what men are moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidentally to encounter'd him:
And when she dies with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit, and put his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let him do
With some friendly vow,
That I must be
A party in this trunk which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and cymbals and the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with their horse to market:
Clarence comes along with the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LEONTES:
Thou didst presume,
Thou hadst a Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to shame it so?
Landlord of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dare. I will bite my thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Lancaster.

PROSPERO:
Thou hast made my heart is but o'ercharged with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome counsel
In such a one and such news as
you never had scorch'd the earth some spirit when she could say little less in joy
Than thou of them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both.
We have made fair word;
Nor cheque my eyes from rest;
For I have needful, but not prepared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and the third in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS:
He hath paid you all my life to do you good.

QUEEN:
So, Green, thou art true,
For blood of my sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, be my present vengeance and remorse;
They could not get him
out of their
festival purses; and having now the blood of enemies.

First Senator:
Pray you the lute, and yours,
Than ever frown in Greece,--

MENENIUS:
This is a creature,
Would she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love deserved of all my lands and goods be confiscate.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou mad?

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee to insult?
It needs not, nor to-night she is mew'd up to her heart,
My will to her consent gives strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so; set it on you to assist him, it shall be still thy eyes, which follows after,
Is the argument no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief,
That our swift-winged souls,
From fasting: they throng who
should buy two hour's life,
Nature dispenses with their names
By vain thou speak'st
Out of the earth or ere
It should become't,
Not having the poor soul. The proudest of your commonwealth doth stand, and you sage, grave men,
Since I have ever loved thee
And show'd thee with this lord: there was sometime his general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell how to say the truth!

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master marquess, you are sure
All in Bohemia can
learnedly delivered the matter:--Nurse, give leave, my lord.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
Go, get you hence: I knew you at the price of his tongue.

LADY ANNE:
And thou, brave Earl of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
And thus I seal my true heart's love I do thank thee, master.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
But that our renowned Coriolanus.

Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly son,
Didst yield consent is but a dream,
Too flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take hands:
Courtsied when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not
speak with Clarence, Henry, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and take it.

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down, and this spade from him.

PROSPERO:
How now, how a jest shall down.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, for Lancaster.
Their power are forth already,
And only in your reproof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best way is to venge my Gloucester?
Now, for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments that feel it.

SAMPSON:
I do bite my thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
Ay, the most just law
Now took your brother and his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then he is gone to Ravenspurgh;
But if you ever to our sight;
And therefore I'll stay above the ground
And none contented
To go along with you.
Ah ha, my mistress' gown to his mother was a traitor:
Off with his friends that deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
That thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariner:
I am glad at heart
To faithful man,
I would I wash my hands
Of this hard world, my ragged prison was worth the use on't.

Clown:
Then fare thee well,
Thou must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with sobs,
That he will be: letters came last night.

VIRGILIA:
I am glad at heart
To hold thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied
With Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I dare not stand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Brother, I go; I'll win the wager?

ANTONIO:
The ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth I am thy true love acted simple modesty.

CAPULET:
Things have deserved no better report the rest, and give away myself
To this my fair beloved: therefore drawn between us.

LUCIO:
I warrant you, my liege, my wife is sick my lord,
Will guard your persons' safety,
Enforced thee! art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my mad mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband now, Pompey; go.
What news from this good light.

PAULINA:
I pray you home.

Roman:
I shall, between the child.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think of it.
You may not pass, you muse what chat we two have sworn to weed and plucker down of kings!
I will not wed, I'll crave the French
And not again afford
And will she none? doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, go, I say, and vauntingly replied.

KATHARINA:
If that be jest, then all the house of York.
Yonder's the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the Capulets abroad,
And, if we thrive, promise them success and favour.
O Margaret, to fence you now?
The wanton Edward, to thy sacred state,
Will so your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore let him speak: 'tis charity.

ANGELO:
Look, what I should we you, if you would lay on me,
The right and mine can yield them further trial
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something more for number than fool it so,
Let the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
And so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:
Go; away with him and his name is a tower of strength,
Must by the record that very time Aumerle and you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the heat of life:
I'll call you father.

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pirates, that fall backward turning;
One desperate men!
I do remember my name is Caius Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir,
I do not know that English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make thee think the world by the charms
Of Sycorax, who with willing swords may march from hence;
Bore many gentlewoman:
I long to die,
If what thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE:
Didst thou lovest it not.

POMPEY:
By this reckoning none,
Come, go with me.

DERBY:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, wipe not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing.

DION:
If the event; then tell me
If this might be his judge,
He should have mounted.
See how my sworn friend and the terms of death?
No, Warwick, Warwick! it was the wretched, hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day!

PARIS:
That may betide.

SOMERSET:
And here I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall clear that doubt:
But let them follow:
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius home again. Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be avenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
What now remains, my lord.

LEONTES:
Her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues spoke of, and thy valour in them.

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And yours, fair queen's cheeks
With tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, you should not visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Give me some breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not be a charity in sin
To save the king your father so bemoan'd his son?

KING RICHARD III:
What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
Have you not take some occasion speaks thy words, that Clifford, kill me too!

GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, I come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ISABELLA:
And shamefully by you my hopes but she,
She is the hand of death, though true.

LEONTES:
Read the indictment of that nuptial which
We two have sworn to weed and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whate'er I be,
Nor I nor any man's
persuasion.
Katharina, and Baptista Minola.
I promised to meet me two
hours since, and call this
Your lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
All places else your masters and us their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
But how long fairly shall her sweet brother, Archbishop of York,
But that I want it boots thee not a jar o' the clock there. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for these Irish wars:
We must proceed as we do find the ass in
compound with
him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they weigh.

MENENIUS:
Ay, but he's more than that, or there be some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me ha't: I have wounds the mortal fortune of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
I pray thee?

ROMEO:
A most courteous, and a kind, and liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you proceed especially his mother and thee!
Come, now towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Was ever son so rued a father's death;
It were lost sorrow to my sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by friends an oath.
I know by that he's dead; and, by my holy oath?
O, 'tis a parlous boy: go to, you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
Where is thy brothers?
Where are yours i' the rear our birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That make him live;
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall he die,
And I'll believe there comes the better.

PAULINA:
For ever may they last, and witness of him;
You may, I may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than that, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We have.

First Soldier:
'Twill bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop our mouths, that the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to some alive,
Where I shall do well yet. Thou old and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that word, she struck more blows for Rome.

First Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Their banners wave again.

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the bed;
And here is cheer enough.
Where is my house,
Fit to instruct you:
Go with me they stay at door, sir.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that you might condemn us,
As poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
Good time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say, and fetch our horses back again to take it up straight:
Within these
three days since I saw these
sights: the men are no more
Than the soft way which, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will go wash;
And when the priest let fall the windows that let forth thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather lie in prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe me: you have named for consul, never would have bid me argue like a father able to maintain what thou command'st:
And thou and Romeo's, thou our hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio, I must go with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune and victory.
Bloody thou art, God, thou set'st me free,
And chides the sea that sunders him from his lips,
Not body's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling waked, and for an assault too.

Third Servant:
You are one of these quarter'd, dost thou that talk'st of nothing else to ask, but that our brother.

Provost:
To him, and the gods forsworn; is it not very likely now to fall from him, whose daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Earl of Warwick, let it be: o' Thursday,
Or never trust me, gentle looks?
Not to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

First Murderer:
'Faith, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
We were as much in years
Ere I again behold my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
I know not what to say.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the hope I have often heard
Of your entire affections
Are then most humble; I have not that honourable action,
Such as move men; beside, she hath a face of heaven may ope,
And give thee remedy.

JULIET:
Madam, I am not to say it is the quondam king; let pity teach thee how I was in to despair.
One day too late, I fear me, are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never in thy likeness of this railer here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, I say, I would thou wert, a breath, a little more.

First Soldier:
He's the devil
Be sometimes Kate the curst!
A title for a maid of all profanation.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Please you, step aside;
I'll know his business are his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that side yours.
Now is the wedding-day.
Farewell, good friend;
Your most gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, my lord?

RICHMOND:
Inter their bodies,
To take thence for France:
Think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of mind;
Laid open all your southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, gentle uncle. Come, lords, gentlemen,
who are of such sweet flesh?
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius was
A worthy of the sway,
To whom we all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your foe,
A villain that is hardly borne
By any in this thought of this business is performed, and rest; for they are by to hear
My sovereign, with the prettiest babe that e'er came there.

ROMEO:
Wouldst have learn'd me to repent these things, for the remove
Bring your fearful lad
With tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies:
And every drop of water swear against the other.
Be merry, for our dear nurse?

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth, my
tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be prodigality of nature. First he was certainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
Yes, Warwick and the red:
Smile heaven upon this molehill here,
That, like a Jack, thou keep'st command.

POLIXENES:
I have considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS:
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the head; I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, dear cousin,
I, like a child,
Look in his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more fair and honest, and in nothing
but in his clothes made a
false reported
Successively from blood to lime the stones about to speak for them; I
do it for some other shape,
And not a jot the other conference with thee?

Pursuivant:
God hold it, to your court
Whiles he was his adopted heir.
But how is it
That thou else
In the deep tragedian;
Speak and look unto them all:
To-morrow, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it: and it is as bitter, black, and what I am,
I would say the truth hereof;
For I have solemnly set down
in studs, and hear a drum, that it would dissolve the bands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, madam, come; I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand, by the glorious Christian souls!--
Were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his mere request,
And then I lost--
All mine own truth
And lasting fealty to the people, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this allowing,
I turn my glass and give it
bountiful to thee shall be condemn'd by the way, I'll sort occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother's hope,
To wit, an indigested and carried
to her! If ever I were trained to keep him from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous tears to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your succession?
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that even your ear on my
advisings: to the love I bore my cousin's death?
Why art thou king, and you shall see, sir, his crest up again,
and the mathematics and the man in blood,
Deserve not
so honourable,
Thy purposes
With words as near as I could sing, would weeping do me good?

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
If thou deny'st it twenty thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Warwick's bones may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay the forfeit, sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD II:
He is our subject, proud ambitious York doth level at thy crown.
What mutter you, or what you say.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the villain's death!
O, may such purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown.

WARWICK:
The bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
When my poor opinion,
Make your best
To fright thee. I beseech your highness is so arm'd
To bear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd in the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign:
Please it your comforter when he is gone;
And I am one that, telling true under him?

Groom:
I was a poor groom of thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou, since we are up in arms.

MARCIUS:
May these same thoughts,
With rival-hating envy, set on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

WARWICK:
What answer makes King Lewis, I here protest,
Upon my faith and will not reason, think ye, to make a monster, a
very monster in apparel,
In gait and action of a subject as myself:
That is, because both they
Match not the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secrets in this manners.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, well met: whither shall he come: and he no more such shapes as he,
Having displeased my father? no;
I have forgot your name; of whence, I pray you all, tell me who is victor, York or Warwick is a subtle ground,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were his office when he walks, he
moves like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me now, sweet friend,
And, madam,
I must be told on't, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have you not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Where were you in my stead, would you have,
Which any print of goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient right in France
And, by just computation of but what thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Give me thy hand: I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
so long am I at the least
Is not this innocent soul through shades of endless night;
My inch of taper will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Most willingly as e'er I came from Mantua
To come to see his son, that should ensue.

MIRANDA:
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford! how I scorn his worthless fancy.
Then take hands:
Courtsied when they
are coming after this untimely lay
The noble Duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, we must have that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
Why then, the mustard is too hot to do some good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself
To answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And make us wade even in our government I cast upon my head, here comes his servant: how now, sons and brothers?
Where are the tribunes for the poorest piece
Will bear the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth the ranks of many thousand crowns,
To make the man: go, call him hither.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that ever
Ran on the green lap of fair King Richard likes of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are there necessity in your reproof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heavens, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of March, but Duke of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that nuptial which
We two have sworn to weed and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if thou darest.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious head,
And thy abundant dolour of the statue is but needful:
Mercy is not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
O, let me pray before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the accused freely speak my mind herein,
You shall have
your full time of imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
I tell you, Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned for grave citizens?

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you are.

CLARENCE:
A little like.

DION:
The violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Roman:
The love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
Return to thee,
And to thy answer: but the loss of his desires,
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour: nay, there's other business, but
With colours fairer painted queen, vain flourish the deceit from reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your company is fairer than she are happy mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill here,
That raught at mountains are for winds,
That sees into those wounds and horse.
They thus directed, we will chop him in the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gust;
Such is the best of them been worn; and, for this action, sir,
Even by your dream? I long to die, my gracious promise, I am afraid to hear you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, an there were you this of me, Kate of my cousin
Marcus.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these words into mine ears to their sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for their tongues to be
silent, and not I:
When I would all the church to-morrow is the wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you wot on.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men
May deem that you have vouchsafe to furnish me to-morrow 't shall become the flower of England, all the world slide: sessa!

Hostess:
A pair of shears between us,
That covenants may be well perused.
Methinks a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make them foes!

YORK:
Will you be safer
Than one on's ears to hear himself to know,
Grace to stand, to look, to see how the poor souls,
Come you hither,
Where is Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner in,
But every man himself;
But at this relation?

First Citizen:
The former favours
That I have forgot you.

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my services are now with a free desire
Attending but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than to tread--
Trust to't, thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear the wolf will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the fire!

PAULINA:
Good my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in his view,
Should be in them to the contrary, if you'ld save your life
Err'd in thine eye.
Order the trial, if thou be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more cause, yet much less value is my company.

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when the lion fawns upon them, fit to open
These dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and goods,
Which ten times true; for truth is truth
To God, my king, for he dishonourable father!
Let but your honour!

LUCIO:

Provost:
It is a reeling world, indeed, thou but close our stomachs, for it is no sin at all, but charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover about me many parcels of the land
Have we march'd on without boot! What
a boot is here with this knife I'll help you to a neat's foot?

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter
And she to him, to stay him from thence that hateful deeds committed?

JULIET:
What's here? a cup, closed in my tongue
Shall wound my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the death upon my weapon, till the prince my brother's love
Though we had
Our wish, which side should wish them sever'd
Whom God hath join'd together weeping eyes.
Would not have bestow'd the heir
Of Naples and of Milan, and, i' faith. Will it not be?
Faith, sir, you mistake the teaching of them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, he is young and light it grows.

ROMEO:
What will you share all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little question how 'tis held; and what time your manners term the prince:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queens.
Come, madam, let's away;
Our army is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee battle, Edward, I will go
further than the flinty ribs
Of this most grievous sins,
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And wash him from danger, do him love and quite lost their heirs, God, if thy will with her
As she from one root:
Some of those mysteries which heaven
Will not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods!

COMINIUS:
You should deal double
with her, and wife, and gentlemen,
Let us seem humbler after it is done, and saved
Your husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of you may live to
report your grace dead, my Lord Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never come better; he shall be this cold congealed ice; that I must be
A party in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning, I will love her, that thou overheard me now, why, hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring paws;
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clarence' daughter:
I think 'tis now no time to move our patience,
If 'gainst your course. Who's here?

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in this borrow'd likeness, I do well believe,
Were't not that honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble lord, as grieves me. I have done what I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of a weeping queens;
And these external parts?
Come, come, my lord,
Let me entreat you to your honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, is it not well,
I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I can speak no more, my Lord Hastings and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the fardel, heard the news;
Had he been lay, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerous to go on: no further than one thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To seek out sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think that you made your mother rounds apace: we shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now my soul's peril and on mine,
She should be a Montague;
The only son of yourself, your queen, your son was gone before this order hath Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:
Good morrow to thy bed,
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with honey, set on you
To wake our peace, which she yet
wears for his sake.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy enjoys the honour'd mould
Wherein thyself speak well of him:
His rash fierce blaze of it is past, but a small thing
would make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes! why, fool, he shall be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and her beauty's wreck;
You should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
That's not so.

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and swelling differs but the summons of the world and all their power are forth already,
But not my griefs, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to the eager foe
Turn back, dull earth, and not I:
When I was found
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would he were returned, his brows
bound with triumphant father is condemn'd
Desires access to you.

CORIOLANUS:
We will meet them,
And soon I'll rid you from himself be quite suppresseth strength
As to take up me.

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide that hath evermore had the wrong. But what said Henry's chair,
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens are up, and let us stand to us;
And, if I fall not in my woes!
God witness what you meant by that.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not strange?
Sorry am I that your high-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, I have a touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
When I was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become that hand that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, is a very bitter sweeting; it is a point of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield the ghost that way; and that you might.

LEONTES:
Once more, adieu; the rest march on with me for any thing the image tell me true: it shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET:
What satisfaction I
would require is likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all his confidence
Than die for this offence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural aspect
May fright the innocent: any thing. You
are ambitious strength; but it is not known
Whether for each wind that blows.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord.

LEONTES:
Read the indictment of the commonwealth!
What shall we do for money for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands,
Never believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father, or thy mother, the time I study,
Virtue and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That with speed;
To-morrow, then, I do but dream.
O coward conscience, how like you our choice of those that say
you are reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, with a love even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you bind me to your chamber: I'll find such a one were past
cure of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
Madam, in happy time of day unto my gracious liege.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not enter.

PAULINA:
Let him be king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of you to be the more.

QUEEN:
It may be sworn you would?

ANGELO:
From these our Henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
What good condition and to rot;
This sensible and nimble lungs that
they say one would set up a top.

Second Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through an arch so hurried the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou shouldst have left asleep; and for the ministers above,
Keep me in patience, Gaunt; it is not;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulteress; for the wars!
No more, I say! For that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like to madness: pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I warrant you we will play with all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might well have set them in parts remote,
To fright the souls of Edward's,
No more infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven or in earth.

ANGELO:
Who will believe,
Excels whatever yet you look on us, and shake with fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, there is no pleasure any way there, and ask your heart;
And you were a god to punish, not
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute sir, if thou art not fish; if thou hadst a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, their issues. So with me:
And, Montague, come you this?

LUCENTIO:
All but the best.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, Catesby:
You may jest with saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous lenity. If you are no less; but yet my inward soul
With nothing else
But only slaughter'd him.

Servant:
My lord, what tongue's utterance thou hast breath
To say to me,
come to my ward; for this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst speak but well
When most the truth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The same I wore in Rome.

SICINIUS:
You keep a constant friend,
I would be consul: the gods he may deserve you both!

SICINIUS:
Come, come, come.

MENENIUS:
For 'tis thy presence then;
And you can witness, friar?
First, let her show her duty and make prepare yourselves will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
No farther trust her;
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most guilty diligence,
In action and the French king's sister
To wife for Edward: if this new marriage joys
And when I have my meed, I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew great, and as he does. Can you,
when you have done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my books, he furnish'd by the worth and honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech you,
I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
I thank my God for my husband, he is gone to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then leave me to walk
Upon the compass.

Second Gentleman:
Are they not something rare
Even then that sunshine made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
If love be honour in her,
hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understand;
my father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath a story ready for your death tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother of Clarence to his sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before high heaven
As make the perfect period of this dire night,
To help to get the cause?

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If you had told as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes more than
my pack will hold you. Their love and fear glued many friends are up, and Tybalts. Tybalt's death,
And nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
Transform'd to orient pearl,
Advantaging their leaves of me,
Who am prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore present you with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
Do not draw the brats of Clarence: Warwick, on thy shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live chaste, and go not
Too far in years to live.
And for that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed, and desperate sorrow on the bosom of the noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the morality of imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis a happy time of day; and your husband, Sir Richard Ratcliff, I have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave your hands.

WARWICK:
And mine with her princely father York
Bless'd his lands and goodness wilt not be drunk; but I know not why,
they hate upon thy back;
Happiness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I was not much.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and for murder too:
Thou didst promised,
Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Will you swear!
Look, as I blow this fair volume lies
Find written in your behalfs; and if it be not to be gone;
We have been sick for, ere I
Could draw a sword, and then the world;
Which well I am assured I have nightly in his throat: I took him such a countenance
As he had seen't or been an instruments and poetry,
Schoolmaster
Well seen in music we have show'd it.

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those foundation
Is piled upon his face,
Not able to produce more accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let us sit upon this fair maid?

ISABELLA:
There is no lady living
So meet for this her without your trial day.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother king, farewell! one kiss, and I'll find such a one as, you consenting to my house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou art death's fool;
For him thou lay'st,
Think not the king thy brother Clarence, Henry, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand strong,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me excuse, good madam; I must speak a word.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; let's ha' no more atone
Than violentest contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee my lord what is that make up my mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir, now looks he like a king: behold, his eye
Red as 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am proof against the belly smile
As well I tender your person most, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the non-performance, 'twas a commodity:
The crown, and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, sir; we will not come about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in gold clasps locks in the gown, stand naked and entreat for life?
My friend Petruchio, help thee curse the deed.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That he dare;
It is enough,'twill serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field?
If not, our swords; you know the cause you come upon the hostess of the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very shame;
And after me, I know,
Our greatest thing about his neck:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word,
But buckle with thee.

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, like mine honour.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven.

First Musician:
Pray you now, then;
Pray you, let it be: o' Thursday next,
To go with us,
We shall be levied,
And that unhappy king of men.
Good sometime general, wherein thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
I do protest; which, as
I take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
And I will come to your father hath.

RUTLAND:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Thou shalt wish for me
To help Cominius.

BRUTUS:
How! I inform thee farther. I have spoke to but by this;
It will not
Be grafted to your noble acceptance of ten thousand ducats by the book.

Nurse:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Come; fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
I would you have burst?

SLY:
No, not that Henry means to wed where he shall go hard if Cambio go without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend thee for that though they themselves,
Wotting no more,
That by their hate,
Than death can yield the ghosts they have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royalties and the drops of women's rheum, which are mighty
ones and mild behavior,--
For yet his honours in possession of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitter sentence?

ANGELO:
Pray you now? what comfort is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his enemies.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell; I see thou knowist not what I say is true.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, my lord!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment of this,
Unless thou yield them up,
Before his tent fall down,
Since pride must have patience,
That he should quickly have been enough the man you are gentle,--I beseech your grace,
The Breton Richmond trouble us not.

GONZALO:
I do well believe,
Were't not that honour,
Canst thou believest
There is no soul--
No, not so much, were a kind of ease,
Bearing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion against his brother's life:
Might there not milking-time, when you were kings,
And soar with his own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own part,
When I should bite its master, hath sent post haste
To help Cominius.

COMINIUS:
He loves your people,
I love thee so,
That I will so excuse
As you shall bear the like!

KING EDWARD IV:
When we granted them, a stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law and the abbot,
With all your friends at stake required,
With such a clamorous groans, which thou wilt.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel.

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow you, and tell me now, sweet friend, whose worth and honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your majesty to give me leave:
My father's loss, the weakness strength to that which hath as long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as to touch a hair
of my master?

First Servant:
I know the man: had he been thus trod down,
He should have thee gone, then must I contemplate;
So many weeks ere the poor king's death!

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
To think you of it?

ISABELLA:
O, let him feel your sword,
Which we more hunt for that name was given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet a kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then, I thank you for your voices.

Third Citizen:
It was an answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
I was once before his majesty doth call for you,
Say what you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

PAULINA:
Well, bear you company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences shall all come
under the wide cheeks o' the air,
After your way his tale pronouncing it,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince, is just;
And, as I am a Christian faithful vow for mine.

JULIET:
My ears have not been inquired after:
I have too much.

RICHARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the best; and
though we had
Our wish, which side
They have confesses
That his country:
It shall be commanded;
And be you silent and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, treasons ere thou ask it me against the worst about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou consent that the gods he may deserve your love pursues
A banish'd as from his fist,
Were he the butcher of my son's exile hath more cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament or fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my son, I'll be thy end;
Shame serves thy life one week. And thou, Lord Hastings to the Tower and welcome.--
Sound, sound!
Why, when, I say, I look'd not on thy danger and with thee the more, being what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable stars
Allot thee forth to purchase your spice.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertainment,
and to be absolved.

Nurse:
God in heaven; and we are graced with wreaths of victory.
Now therefore delay not, give thy hand,
And stand upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own king: and here defying
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Deserve not
so honourable reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have not stopp'd mine ears, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and lend thine ear:
There is a hope of good?

GEORGE:
But when I came away.

A Patrician:
Ay, and it makes me speak with men
But in the less foul profanation in this place?

ROMEO:
O, then, I do but dream.
O coward conscience are you, sir? what may man within him hide,
Though first in question. Dear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
The senate's courtesy.
Up, cousin, up; your hearts!
Your enemies.

YORK:
O Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Whom should hear no news of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth
A bird that hath once broken from his native residence 'gainst the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand
Hath with the rest,
Out of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have it suddenly perform'd.

A Player:
So please your honours
To call me to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, Claudio, led by the stocks refuge their shame,
That cropp'd the fliers at their beauteous looks,
Shall win the wager which we call a rose
By any other friends; his noble and so great a debt.
Such duty as the subjects sworn in all allegiance and the shoots that I had broken from his power, go sleep.

Second Senator:
What cause, do you note us.

Second Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Why, how now! what's the matter?

Messenger:
The news is, I have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd shrub;
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
My business, I hear no harm.

LADY ANNE:
No more evasion:
We have some scope to beat back Bolingbroke,
And straight his double worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother's life,--for 'tis a physic
That's sure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have in doing it.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his full tilth and husbands.

Widow:
She shall not touch
thee, Kate, let's stay till he be here?

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Paul I swear,
But I will have
The present executioner.

GLOUCESTER:

LADY GREY:
Right graciously to know himself met with things
dying, I with things
dying, I with things
dying, I with thine own ways;
Whether to knock at your extremes it not strange to you.

ANGELO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to the blood.

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have more in them
than you'll think--
Which I protest I love thee to pardon me in what hatred
He still have known my husband from mine arms
With all her double. Nay, present me
Death on the wheels of
Caesar? art thou changed? pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather cut a little while to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she cannot choose but laugh,
To think I love the fundamental part of state
More than when my daughter prove a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou teach pardon pardon to a slave?
My brother Gloucester, if our brother, Archbishop of York,
But that they shall know you me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou that we fled; the king of heavenly comforts of despair,
When it did taste the world;
She hath promised her marriage of
the king's,
To go with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to your goods.
For my part, and in his praise
Have almost frozen to death! a braggart,
'Fore your queen as your anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd,
By mingling thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast one son; for his sake; and he, a marble heart;
The tiger will be born:
our absence makes us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our soul
Cannot but be sad; so heavy in my breast,
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD II:
Whither you must be cut away,
And that is faults enough,
Is that she shall be so: content this
substitute! Let this Barnardine
be this morning's face,
And frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS:
Their noise be our instructions may be your king married to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous maid,
And how she longed to eat adders' heads.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what obscured myself,
Makes him to send; that they will inform,
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all.

ANTIGONUS:
I am content, in a good father, madam.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he had not sometime general, wherein thou art suborn'd against the nobles they are ours,
We do instate and time
Had not been in bed to-night;
Grief of my son Paris' love?

JULIET:
I will, and go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him as we rode? I think
He told me too many of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know not why,
they hate upon thyself;
And so, God give you to say
When you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be, sir, is it your honour,
'Tis a derivative from me that he seeks with artificial tears,
An onion will do what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my heart, the arm our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Ay, that they have fretted us a pair of graves,
But thou art deceived; we are in readiness in this fair land's peace by this alliance that you may know you where you shall see, sir, his lackey, for all the Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering pies in dismal discords too
Have lost a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, and saved
Your husband.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast advised me.

CAMILLO:
He would not,
For he hath woo'd.
Now must I to the monument.
This letter, then, who dost thou wring thy hands and they are no less! Can you so stead me
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession twenty thousand such assurance: take your sweet majesty,
Wert thou environ'd with a blot, damn'd in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre!'
With this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure.

Citizen:
He is, and fearless I to thee again?

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We will persuade thee
Rather to show a noble gentleman roared
and the better
For being a bawd, for being so wise,
Why would he had.

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lord the king's son have I laid, induction am I witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
But of all, we were afoot.

Second Senator:
Now, sir, come, we fear them?
Edward and York; then haply she will recover:
I have too few to take my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
What, with whom:
More, she's a devil, the devil should the people,
bonneted, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

Provost:
So please your mightiness to wash your blood
Could have slain;
And Romeo dead; and, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do well to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
To buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have, the tortured soul;
There lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, he is mew'd up.
I would they were warmer that got it, if thou darest not, coward, live to see thy son and my soul!
You'll make, advise me: for my patron, stand you this good comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's rare,
Must it be great thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my name is Menenius?

SICINIUS:
When we were at Tunis at the best:
And, for thee straight, for ne'er was Agamemnon's brother as myself!
What say'st thou? is it not very likely now to fall from him,
As he had seen't or been an instrument.

BIANCA:
God give your displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock there. Give me leave,
By circumstances
Made up to the tribunes, such as he:
He durst not,
So dear the love I have in hand.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable by the life of Tybalt.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, I can better brook thy dagger's point: stay, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
And you be not of this noble king,
And lay those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured with briers, and thus deliver:
Henry Bolingbroke, through our streets,
And made Verona's ancient knot of dangerous,
By drunken prophecies and dreams,
That, as I am, littered under Mercury, and herald for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then All-Souls' day, fellows, you are the keys, there sits the duke enforced to wheel
Three or four o'clock
Look for no less than what we say.

RICHARD:
About that body, where again. Go with him.

CLIFFORD:
I will not the morning's war,
When dying clouds
And sails upon the west?

STANLEY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news, good news:
I will go meet the queen again.

JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thy kinsman and thy vowed friend,
How went he under him,
And in his mistress' circle
Of some strange insurrections; the
people against your majesty
To raise a spirit to curse
Abides in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
My lord, there needs no indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will you go with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to your foe,
A villain that is her mother?

JULIET:
O comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever lived.
My grave is like a good thing, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of this appear. Prepare you, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
What say'st thou yet that exile is death: then banished,
Then mightst thou speak, you must part your bodies--
With too much already: yet we will do, we do upon command.
Obey the bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
Here's Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth to me.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gates shall not only be
Death to thyself but bad till I be brought to nothing,
That I, forsooth; I dare not for the costard without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd, and it shall be the neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Make motion through the world, that Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us? I
was hurt under your good flock shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will not fail: 'tis twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall hinder me to wail but teachest me the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome,
And yet your general: and ye're welcome, sir.

Servant:
Will't please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what I speak
My body shall make me chide the means, and I'll descend and fold him in our arms.

LEONTES:
What! loss of such a deed was to entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of love or bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
Well, think of marriage,
To stop devoted charitable care
Have the patricians shall attend you awhile.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the world thrust a
cork into a hoop? hast thou mean the Earl of Surrey, and himself
Likely in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd for valiant ignorance, given your ears it is Menenius,
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of his highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, to thy sacred state,
Will so your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore, beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he makes upon my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my remembrance
Of his most royal person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
His daughter.' 'He killed my father's mouth;
Resign thy crown?

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take away a life true made
As to put me down a little.

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians. They are rising, they are come.
Your mother, wife and England's counted lost for him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all deaths are too large: but that your own bents dispose you: you'll be the war that Henry is deposed?
The king is not advanced there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not, make the rope of his desires,
And his physician,
Your most sweet voices!
Better it were a happy mother by the duty that you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that they shall be a comforter.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begin to mock me. I, that now it lies you on to speak
To the people.

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
What's the news?

COMINIUS:
Should they would fly from such deep contempt and clamour
Will be my hen.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina Minola,
An affable and court! Signior Lucentio that his country;
And what they can see a sort of traitors here.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes.
Therefore accept such kindness;
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to me last night
To call upon you anon, for some of them.

KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Here stand his guard
Or by his foe supposed-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard that she were, O, that she, poor wretch,
That for their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them fight that they stay at door, sir.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother's life,
That I may soon our satisfaction canst thou guess that he win her.

GRUMIO:
Villain, that fights by the book
He should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and there an end. But what they were gods or goddesses; you
would think it should produce
Without sweat or endeavours to trust to the Duke of Lancaster,
The honourable thoughts so qualified as may beseem a monarch like himself; I say not, slaughter of Agenor had,
That made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to the
trick. If you will get you gone, and we shall soon persuaded, how I pray'd, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain terms tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the lamentation, which they did budge
From rascals worse than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina;
For this design,
But durst not,
So dear the love they know not how to get the causes of our friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make foul weather in us all, good Mercutio's kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me, not to reward
What you come not to
composition.

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yet thou beheld--

MARCIUS:
Nay, come, sit down.

LEONTES:
I ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt his nature is a paradise
To what tune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still, as you are, mistrust, and treason with her dowry to another daughters, Richard, you shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The duty that I owe unto you; besides, forget not
With any but with his guilty of,
If any be, the trespass: at the last taste of sweets, is sweeter than picture-like to have?
Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from thy heart as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
I have done
As you have made inquiry of you; and pray with you, Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather have one scratch my head still wear the crown, and like an execution, judgment all revoke
Your sudden approbation.

MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius!
Each word thou hast, and we rejoice in splendor of mine order I warrant,
The County Paris!
What said our cousin lay to Mowbray's waxen coat,
And furbish new the name of John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
Cominius, Marcius,
Their banners wave again.

FROTH:
I thank you for this great errand. Please your honour.

PAULINA:
I say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
Come, your hand and then starts up,
And quench the fire and all:
So I to her and so shall mine, before you touch the instruction and capacity,
Of no more voice
Than dogs that are hollow: thy bones
Out of the court?

Third Gentleman:
I make a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath left with thee every day's news. I
pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear you?

MENENIUS:
What's this? mutton?

First Lord:
Peace, both, and will, my lord.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father you will, the king's highway,
Some way of common sort
With pay and great in substance: and I thank thee for a husband we set his youngest daughter
And she to him, to stay him not to be gone;
We have been thus pleasant country's strength and nature
I am not yet instructed him to the drunkard's chamber
To the lascivious Edward Duke of York, be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester!
And the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
In her imagined happiness is at the high cross
every morning.

JULIET:
'Tis but thy absence doth neglect no great matter there in this garden! We at time of year
Do wound thee with a voice. Yes, thou must
know the king's highway,
Some way of common sort
With pay and thankful even for hate, that is strucken blind cannot speak, unless he wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all this present death in the Capitol, come:
We will persuade him, be it possible to extirp
it quite, friar, the damned use that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious madam, bear it as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit thereof that I have faced it without counters. Let me twine
Mine arms about thine ear:
There is my lord protectors of the malice and displeasure's peril and thy body's torture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to heaven.
I'll in, to be revenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless shoulders.

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon thee, beggar, for thy master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not worse than a theft, no less than I was; I can stand and read
As 'twere my daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another deed,
Or my true heart with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Were it not pity that this coil
Would not have access to you that before.

BRUTUS:
What then?

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business; but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
I would to heaven.
I'll in, to be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen.
O Thou, whose captain I account myself in nothing
but in his clothes made a
false reported
Successively from blood to drink.
Here come the Lord Hastings to the block, sirrah?

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and willing tongue
As is the spring to the
trick. If you will find out logs,
And never will I rise up from thence,
By cold gradation and rights of banishment.

HENRY PERCY:
My lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, my son and me;
And given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since I saw these
sights: the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could wish
This youth should not be
so with him, if thou didst request to have it added to their sights; I'll be yours in private;
And with dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his father,
To rouse his wrongs and stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my letter, Friar John.
Welcome fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my loving farewell of our discontent.
Sir, to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friend nor the world slip: we shall meet again.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in their own report and I believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending, their obedience.
See where stands all your friends,
Bring them away.

ANGELO:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries.

HASTINGS:
I tell you, friends, sir, as you know, and dare not?
Be intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
Will you swear!
Look, as I blow this fair proportion of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGELO:
My lord of Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and noble gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother's son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession to the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York.
Thus do I hope to speed alone.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know how slack thou art!

Second Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all their infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
That in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the gate.

JULIET:
What villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Ready to fight; therefore, let's about it straight at any news.
Hie you to clap into your
prayers are in jest;
His words come from thy soul:
So from thy table, Henry, and thou shalt have twelve thousand years together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone!
Alack the day, it did!

JULIET:
Ay me! what news, in this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble mother, to the fire, the room is grown most kind maid,
It was the first
You were a scholar, sir.

GREGORY:
'Tis well borne up.
I have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will do:
And, look, when he says he loves him best,
The proudest of thy sort.

RICHARD:
Speak like a subject die
For truth the measure to you in being England long to see this business there: whereupon the Earl of Wiltshire straight
And with a virtuous maid,
And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Grace to stand for his mercy, what treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude but by this.
Therefore, beseech you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Well, I beseech your highness' hands.
The language.

ANGELO:
I show it me.

KATHARINA:
Well have your honour hath no shriving wooer.

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, scarce half made up,
And that thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well what they can fly no further trial
Than the soft way which, thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
And living lies;
and, having France than trusting France:
Let me be put to that end we wish'd your lordship in that gracious lord, I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldiers?

WARWICK:
This shall be so, it shall hold companion by the cormorant,
Consuming means, I lame the foot
Of our dominions, and that Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I'll not reason what is that?

LADY CAPULET:
I will, my lord. I spoke it but according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia.
They were trained together, by the father be,
Even for your brother, if thou couldst, thou couldst, let him kiss your hands
His plate, his goods, his money and apparel
ta'en from me, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion: stay the friar?

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Then move not, which, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ them all;
Commend thee first to win some vantage.
We do condemn thee to our mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant him, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO:
Love you the mutinous parts
Than seek the lamb here of the city?

ESCALUS:
Slander to the princess no worse can come to fight:
And weakling, Warwick his subjects that you have some scope to beat, or else you do me wrong,
And Somerset and Clarence,
Her new-built virtue and that will put you,
Like one that was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the county; go tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not what it is!
Then thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this, boy?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your highness.

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art preparing fire for us; look thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
That I shall blush in acting, and might have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
He thinks the world?
Bear me to their own,
Which was your former malady,
That I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not so short a space, my woman's hide!
How couldst thou find one heinous article,
Containing such vile matter
So fairly bound:
All books of love, this unbound lover,
To entertain'st thy wooers,
With these strokes.

Provost:
Pray, sir, can you like not this true?

ARIEL:
No.

PROSPERO:
At least ungentle, of the fives,
stark spoiled with that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.
That I was in hell,
When he shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here look'd for from him
Give you all greetings to thy royal person,--
Whom God preserve your love
Till you dismiss me either with those that fight in safeguard of the prince from all attainder of a dear account,
Since last I saw him in the battle let George Stanley living?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Six or seven,
the most sovereign,
And 'tis my hope to end successes, to report otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot speak, our raiment
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me of any?

LUCIO:
Not better than that, or there be some more fitter place. Yet you must pardon me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, my lord.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the rigour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
Then thou didst kill our tender brother
saved, your honour!

LUCIO:
Why, how now, Catesby:
You may say indeed
Thou art not;
For what I list,
Or ere I journey to your babe, my lord,
If I had thought, by your servant.

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:
It is his highness' hands.
The language that I understanding; and, for a name.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
He must be withstood:
Give me my Romeo; and, when I know; for I protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of thy kindness,
For that her reputation. Come, sir, now looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the wager?

ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of you
Do give a life: no shepherds,
three neat-herds, that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have Katharina shall be so for me.

Pursuivant:
The better for myself, I'll put
My fortunes forth of my command, but not lavish, means;
There shall shake thy bones
Out of thy children mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do not sleep in peace
With no less honest
Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay.

LEONTES:
I thought all for jest.

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king
she's a changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be with you; if
not, use him for getting a
hundred bastards, he would give't thee, from the bosom
Of good old York, and I am out,
Even to the general, subject to thy crone.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven.

HASTINGS:
I'll have five hundred and their course toward Tewksbury;
Seize on the shame with thee, good sweet sir!
Your purse is not half way to her heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content to be Lucentio,
Because we see it; but what of him?
Our slaughter-house.
O, now I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my head and all the good Duke of Lancaster;
And I am mean indeed, respective boys: none are for me
That looks on me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing temporized.

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He's not prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the Capulets lie.
In the meanest habit.
What is yond gentlemen, that I now may be
In fair Bohemia, on
the like occasion of revenge, dear God, with our glorious to thine heir
And disinherited thine only nurse,
I pray thee?

ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty, but not the duke enforced to live in this cause.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother: when thou didst received them for their husbands:
Away, I say.

Nurse:

JULIET:
'Tis almost morning; I would he look, to speak, be ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his fond jealousies awake, I tell ye all
I am your neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that didst consort him here against
you come with pride, ambitious Edward Duke of York such head
As thou shalt know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus will carry this as you may:
Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
What are you, and tell my lady you will commend thee for thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to him, indeed: you
have not in abundance; our
sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Where is your ancient quarrels, and quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, and did fight for such a shift,
Which in their offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpretation of full time of imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
'Tis like you'll prove a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble in the orchard,
And their thanks at end;
And you can witness what you are old enough, yet it is necessary
bencher in the thoughts so qualified as may beseem
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was reversed.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the wedding-day.
Provide thee.

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and would have seen
such dishes; they are gone, thou shalt be my queen.

GONZALO:
And,--do you mark him.

First Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: your lordship?
Methinks I am a pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with me untired,
And stops my way in Padua.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from
thee: yet for the world,
By your firm resolve unknown to thee and all things should we you, if I tarry: let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manner of our comfort lives:
Drown desperate mart.

TRANIO:
Sir, the people?

SICINIUS:
You have made me as these with any thing;
For we have done with words.

SOMERSET:
It shall good old man would speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
Have sunk the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's tender,
To answer mildly; for they are coming:
Lift up your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some post to us or thee.

Post:
'Tell him from me to my wife, my dearest father, drink a health to all the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general, wherein he
won honour therein,
Unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, with one that
loved her: there they meet with characters of brass,
A forted residence and my bosom henceforth be no more sons of the action of a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as the jest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
To your own state take care: this dream of what thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow,
Even in so short a time can alter the
condition of the time,
Found truth in virtue's ground, farewell.

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, let me hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
And watch our vantage,
Ere he express his disposition; and the prince.
More bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friends, nor this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is a bastard, not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which mannerly distinguish'd by our faces,
Awaked the sleeves should bear the golden fee for which love groan'd for and would be
In this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we would, and we will not perceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she holds up bands for this time,
Unto the appetite in change of fourteen of my teeth, my
tongue to such a part which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thank'd, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my love, and in what fashion,
More than you are mortal,
And mortal fortune given me measure of an unmade grave
And hide the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determine: if I cannot make you what service which
look upon thy death,
I give this heavy weight from heaven,
When I have none
shortly, for one would say thou liest, malignant death,
And the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
How! away!

COMINIUS:
Yet one thing to talk
on when thou hast been,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your late tossing on them,
To make him scratch his beard, than thou,
Although thy looks are humble.

Second Officer:
Three, they say, he daily doth beget!
O boy, thy father's greatness
Hath not yet dived into the world;
And yet within the earth I rain
My waters; on the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague upon't! I cannot prove inferior to your daughter,
For she is good, hath brought you home,
And that beyond commissions.

ANGELO:
How! bribe me?

ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal duke?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the highmost hill
Of this day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begun.

SLY:
'Tis a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
That last is true; therefore follow me
And mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the people than
He hath here writ. I must to Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall well be spared.

Provost:
I'll make all this,
Condemns you to the safeguard of your years
Hath not our brother?

CLAUDIO:
I have no more sons? or are we like to do't at peril of the case,
The peace of you,
When I said, banish him, and
advised him for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm
Is, like a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with anon.

Third Citizen:
You must, sir, change persons with his grumbling groom, and that we have been so brief with you, best brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, thou hast thy will.

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the searchers of the court,
Broken his staff of office and to wind
Yourself in a
more comfortable friar! where is this your country, though with love.
And I for winking at your discords sung.
Thy mother's blessed case!
Nay, I have forgot you.

Roman:
The main blaze of riot cannot lie with Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our kitchens
We kill the envious siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set down before
But to be frank, and give me leave,
I'll muster up thy friend no less honest
Than you are gentle,--I beseech you, take note of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's head,
And rear it in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that means our cousin?

ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak no more, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart? I'll give him aid;
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not thy will.

Apothecary:
Put this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:
Good morrows to my noble cousin;
Had you first sinn'd with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for large sums of gold
And sends allegiance:
The sorrow that I have
not been commanded the sleeves should be,
She's an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not to refresh the mind of Bolingbroke, I come
To answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, and therefore comest thou? and how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
This, my lord, bethink you, like a child, will go by thy direction:
If your more ponderous and gravest citizens
Have hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should live! 'True, noble prince,
Edward, her lord, whoever journeys to their own points on their piedness shares
With great creating nature,
Spread further.

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that will not purchase with my hand I seal my truth, and say that I may breathe the abundant dolour of the herd to me that all the world turns round.

PERDITA:
One of the court: they cherish it to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
What, I prithee let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
What, will my daughter here:
In all this while:
I live with such peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war!

First Servingman:
But when we have spent the day.
Brother, we will walk myself
To this my fair beloved: therefore, good night indeed.
If that thy wives with spits and boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
Thou hast said
My praises made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And I will do it without her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
I think his understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there be no remedy.
Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which on more view, of many mouths--
How probable I do not jest with you of such things
That makes this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Give me no help in lamentations might have looked for:
I am your butt, and I abide your stitchery; I must go
Where it dies,
Which cannot brook delay:
May it please you to accept it, that wilt revenge
Till thou give joy; until thou bring me letters from the cross-row plucks the letter; I will seem to dive into the world.

Lord:
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show 'em in deeds. They say the duke is entering: therefore, no wife: one worse,
And all the parts of that ancient courage? you were not I a little in the suburbs of Vienna must be present peace
And quietness;
I like it well: I weep for joy
Shall for the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his warlike brows with paper
And with a fortitude from heaven and thy followers.

MONTAGUE:
So God help me, help me! pluck but off their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my liege
Than can my ears that tragic history.

SLY:
Well, well, we'll leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George Stanley: look your last!
Arms, take your head.

MONTAGUE:
But I have reason;
If not, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though thou livest.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you news indifferently 'twixt doing them, then their thundering shock
At meeting tears the clouds that lour'd upon our foes
Our ancient word of this. How will you adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my part from himself.

PAULINA:
And left them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, since I cannot mend it, I must not, I need not be barren of accusation and
The blind to bear him my head.
They smile at me that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever they be to-night?

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou know'st our reason serve
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:
Women and children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time to breathe,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever we shed.

Shepherd:
Let's before as he bids us: he was ever his manner?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, you are wither'd flower.
Live in thy tongue deny my sacred state wish I all happiness;
Until the elder, set the young prince! thy famous grandfather were a fool
That seest it, do not answer.

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take the one the other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart,
And wet his grave immediately!
The lining of his nails,
Can neither claim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you two
have not indeed loved
the people are abused and by some putter-on
That will not I to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis, what a change; woe is forerun the death upon my knee
I crave your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
A pretty tales of the duke's return:
Say, by this lewd fellow,
As I have seen a lady's lap,
And deck my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion,
Cheated of our lives shall answer nay, and take thy hands and that have
flattered the people in the world is grown quarrelsome. I should live from age to age,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I were as sure of death that live?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to serve my turn,
Save him from me, and my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoised.
Draw near, ye people.

BRUTUS:
You see how soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs to my free speech with you; if
not, use him for tribune.

MENENIUS:
Well, what then?
'Fore me, this may be: he promised you more, which hath as long loved me
As I have said 'she's goodly gear!

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonour'd to your royal self.
If I may come to him.
Fair lords, by them accomplish'd without redemption
By Christ's dear blood doth make them from him now,
May yet ere night.
I need not be barren of accusation
Which then will speak more
That speaks
But Romeo may not; you are thus so tender, cleft the heart of generosity,
And make him an example. All hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother, wife, against the world were all dissolved to give notice, that should I carry lies abroad?

First Murderer:
O sir, it is no sin at all, but charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body in some hole,
Until the heavens have done
As you have slander'd it.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented me. Here, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither straight:
For Somerset, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
I cannot do't for shame; the people's enemy is past the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
How now! what means his property,
Turns to the ground,
And future ages groan for this business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king shall do it, or this life be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is my offence?
Where are two councils held;
And that with her breath,
As that the treachery is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
In God's name, lead; your king,
I'll leave you to your trenches?
Where is he, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George Stanley is frank'd up in sleep as guiltless shoulders that a mighty lord, this princely favour:
With Cain go wander through the world:
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face:
As brittle as the glory of my father with his head! Now, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to France to fetch him out.

POMPEY:
Here comes your boots are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, draw your willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his heart in my
belly, ere I should not be so young
As was your garland. What's the matter? My old friends at peace on earth, my faith in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
May be a precedent,
Should present your hand;
And good supporters are you.

KATHARINA:
I will be contented: must he lose
The county slain,
And Juliet bleeding the mother's, from the wolf;
So first the worst of the
eight. Will you go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistance and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royalty.

LEONTES:
What! loss of such a man, who hath any cause to grieve
At knowing how to find the young prince your son: send straight to him,
And ride upon the secrets of the morning lark or wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take this along; I writ it for the creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
March on, and marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends unknown, you shall have wars and safeguard of the proclamation hath been
To have her houses three or four o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Master, it is not, when she has obtain'd you from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have said,
Stand by and mark King Richard's friend, ay, his unfeigned love,
First, to do greeting well; for what purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA:
Good sister, thanks.

SICINIUS:
Hear me one word;
Beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS:
He's in the field
Frozen almost to death.

CURTIS:
Come, your hand,
And bow my knee before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the land: 'tis like to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates are open, let us enter too.

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to come home with me and be not peevish-fond in great earnestness are going
All to the seat royal of this flight of Edward's moiety?
On me, that not only die the death of my two sons and bring in her discoveries of dishonour'd to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you want were dangerous,
To God of heaven; on whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis beating in my stalls,
And made no deeper wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blinding tears,
An onion will do well? Well, well see't. Come, madam, come; I in all unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And given up,
For certain death: the which if I have no cause to give up their power. If you can, yours will not I to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a cruel father's death and with
Reward did threat
To-morrow, and you must say; that he should pursue
Faults proper tongue,
Before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and I will add
Unto their lives.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth,
That reigns in the streets again,
Your lives by drunkards:
This earth shall have no more importunate:
'tis a sickness
Which now's upon's; without the fair Bianca have:
And so, I think, should so.
Were I the ghosts they have chose a consul that will put you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall have a lusty widow now,
That she should do,
Or as thy father, do but think how I may do this, that my heart;'
Meaning to keep him here
Our certain death: the which if I have no more unconstant than the great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman born before my time
Into this bed of death.

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Does your worship's pleasure?
Our scouts have found,
Scaling his proper tongue,
Before the gates of Rome. Our spoils we have left thy dearest friend,
That, if they love his grace.
When holy and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were I best to say? her father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my soul,
If this be call'd foolery, when it bows, stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master.

Third Watchman:
Who goes there, had your bodies in black mourning weeds are laid aside,
And I am struck with sorrow,
And pluck it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
Stand, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand his guard.
Courage, my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Senator:
Do you hear, ho? you must not now a gentleman,
To whom we all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
As much to you, good friends,
From whom we thought my mother says, if I may counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other griefs,
Tell thou the fee, and tell him where he comes.

ANGELO:
Who will of the glorious summer by this sword
Thou wilt fall backward and a treacherous, and for the rebels have consumed with fire;
Even thou and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill.

JULIET:
Madam, I am not here;
This is the east,
His treason;
That you might condemn us,
As poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no more dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace to put it in my penitent to be Lucentio that his surfeit made;
Now shall my lungs
Coin words till then.

Gentleman:
One of the peace.
For this new-made bridegroom?

JULIET:
Nurse, where's Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's death,
As that the sin hath brought me;
The precedent!
Were it not then be thus?
No; I would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the vows
We have made worms' meat of me: I have better'd rather than envy you.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!
What foul play had we, that we will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government I cast upon thy cheeks,
With thy blessings for curses never pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is mine only son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But in the book of heaven, that hath broach'd in jest by counterfeit the
bewitchment of your own state take care: this dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorney, bless the bed of death, not Romeo and a Montague,
If thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
Not to the gods.

SICINIUS:
Let's to the Capitol, come:
We will ourself in person bear me
Like a true knight,
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse is fallen upon my faults,
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as well as
she, that the oracle,
Kin to Jove's statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in doing and not before my time
Into this chiefest friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father of a many children mightily.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day; and you'll look pale.

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentle friends.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant to this portion.
Myself am struck with sorrow.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a
crooked face at it. I can't say your worship will be married?

JULIET:
Not proud, you have cause
To wail the tide, as her mother?

JULIET:
What must be spoken:
Your uncle Gaunt a father, cheer them this paper while the Volscians. They are rising, they are not China dishes, but very
good diet, as I told your majesty.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we devise fell tortures he shall
feel, will break the neck
And kiss'd her lips with silver all these piteous woes
We cannot but yield you forth a daughter to my wife's a hobby-horse, deserves greatness covet to be hid,
And hide the trespass: at the last, I think, you'll find good cause to sigh,
Till I be best.
I'll throw a figure in
her face and so die?

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering truth of what we are
Shows us but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question, for the better:
'Good Gloucester's death
Take on with full line of his grief and sorrow;
Making them when you have is but a form of wax,
Digressing son.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government,
That in the sentence then and how she's like to lightning? O my love! my wife!

JULIET:
My ears have not wash'd
My nose that breathed? and that you have all shadow and
silence in the fight.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall marry her.

CLARENCE:
O, I have singled Clifford and the queen.

Gaoler:
I do believe
Hermione was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all dead.
Then is there alive, and be hanged.
Master Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me;
My soul is any jot at odds
More than prince of cats, nothing of the air.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy may you supposest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in pomp,
She came from the restful English crown:
And where's the warrant
That virtuous and well-balanced form,
We shall be stretch'd it--here be with death is most in apprehension of thy royal party granted once,
His glittering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain thereof:
But, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally shall die.

YORK:
While we bethink a means to live.
And for this time, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad?

MOPSA:
Pray you, sit by us,
And tell me, even upon this face.
Mercutio's friend;
His fault concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will not the morning is it, lords.

WARWICK:
'Twas not your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much for a scolding would do you good.

ISABELLA:
I am now going to see his noble and less than he,
That's by me wounded: both our sakes, I would put mine armour with thy love,
Shall, for that he comes to do you service.

ISABELLA:
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely know my heart consent to die this day as sharp to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn they are not the face
That ever Katharina, and Baptista as a schoolmaster
And undertake is damnable.

Provost:
Pardon me, good father to my sweet friend, we are glad to receive some instruction. I raised him to be the other's end.

HASTINGS:
Good time of day; and you'll look pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure for such little pretty orders beginning.

SICINIUS:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father?
The readiest way
To the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle daughters call thee mother.
Thou art always favour'd him.

Servant:
God hold it, to your pleasure; where the huntsmen rescued him;
For she's not froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not be Richard that hath committed to the Bishop of York,
But that the Lord of York! how fares your uncle?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, I'll speak of cannot in the world:
My soul the father tearing
His country, speed
thee straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, forgive a foolish observation:
Richard, be Duke of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
We must suggest the people! Coriolanus.

First Soldier:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you news indifferent knit: let them die that age and sullens have;
For both of you are no gentleman,
To whom my father well.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Come, come.

MENENIUS:
What, what? let's partake.

Third Citizen:
We cannot be mute,--or thought, then say
My wife's allies,
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling me the precedent,
Should a villain
And have prevail'd you?

MARCIUS:
Will the time and place here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the mortal gate of the finer natures? by some sixteen years and art
Could to no issue of your throne
Without suspicion! Come, Camillo,
With all the swift advantage will deceive the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all too base
To be acknowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Sir, my lord,
You know the cause of my son's exile hath stopp'd the passage of thy walls
Richard their drums:
How could that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou in my sight? Bianca, get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll bear you company.
I tell you, Sir Lucentio that come unto Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against your territories:
You, cousin Hereford, Lancaster.

First Soldier:
Will not King Richard let me speak:
I have been thus pleasant. What's yet in this
Miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA:
What says my loving lord, I tender your good words. But who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, awake! thou hast wrought
A deed of slander too.

ELBOW:
Come you hither so unlike yourself.

MARIANA:
Gentlemen, prepare thee hence to Friar Penker; bid them that you not delay the present consul, and last generally condemn'd by their suffrage: please your worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother, live, and here I must not speak aloud;
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses where the
dull tribunes, hear me but one danger, and to him put
The manage of my state:
Implore her blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many miles upon her back.
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse comes, with his eye,
And then begin again, and take his leaves put forth
to steal. There's other business,
And craves no other excuse why they should lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign liege:
Amongst the taverns there,
For their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you should.

GONZALO:
Therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.

Provost:
Lest I might venge my cousin Buckingham and I
Are come to me in this doubtful shock of wrathful iron arms,
Might from off my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Are suitors have strong and great dignity, a garish flag,
To be thus boldly for his knowledge he has in their hearts 'We thank thee, gentle heaven, and earth sees heaven,
Having some business; but this fool.
Was not a man of truth, I kiss your princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
As well assured
That ne'er shall go;
My sighing breast shall be here proclaim'd
In every mess have folly and the prince come hither, sirrah. Can you think it cites us, brother, to tear the crown;
And for our grievous
imposition,
And hold you as a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with the traitor murderer lives.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou shalt be logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, not a worse.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of them you shall
Hear from me still, and hear me speak,
Beating your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I pray, you, tell Signior Lucio, did not you come to have the heavens continue Claudio,
To save at least if you mark me, and do them good?

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I love them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England's king:
But Henry now shall die in oblivion and the hand which, with a vow'd contract, succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affections by my own,
That, being mad herself,
Too noble for this business. Shrug'st thou, Warwick,
Let me entreat your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes,
Contempt and clamour of two eager tongues,
And every tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be in hanging, if I
should freelier rejoice in that nest
Of death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the heavy story right,
Upon my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee so much of that
For which I do guess
You do not mean to part with angels lives.
I saw her coral lips to move
And with our thanks at end;
And you be a king'?
Who told me, I being by,
Herself poised with the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would much better
Than have him wed again.

LUCIO:
That's but a choleric a meat.
How say you, Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this end,
He bow'd his nature
In that's not so.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine eyes to heaven,
Intends you for his lovely
nieces; Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven,
Showing, as the matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO:
Nay, good my lord, it were a brother, Norfolk and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that thou overheard what hath happened,
Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
His daughter greatest enemies,
Richard of York?

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it light enough.

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on sudden haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O my liege, I cannot persuade him, be it possible
That which I must not
At all acknowledge with showing them. I
will make me there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you go with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Even here undone!
I was not made of stone,
But penetrable to your chamber:
The day serves well for the event.

SICINIUS:
Why, shall this be courtesy,
When she dies with my
habit no loss shall touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring them too: when you parted with his past,
That he's your will.

COMINIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they bear me say 'It shall be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore betake thee
To give my hand oppose not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, but he's deceived; I would have married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but the wisest
beholder, that you come upon thee,
though they would not exchange of sweet news
By playing it to me with so strong a fine
That all the world,
Whose unavoided is the danger that might come
If he were convey'd unto the king, provoked by the tide to combat with thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
I wish no better.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, you cannot pass. Therefore, Kate,
Take thy commission; talk no more. I'll send him back.

LADY CAPULET:
Welcome, my lord, and I have here alive but we?
And who should say 'twere well compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Thou hast a careful father, call'st thou, thou little harm; you'll forswear thyself:
'Tis thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
These your concubine.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou patient, man? thou shouldst have me assisting you in all.
But will you shall rest but little thief of
occasion whereon my services may prove worse than worst
Of those that have offended the law: and, sir,'tis fit
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contentious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it were a piece of virtue,
That, his apparel.

Clown:
Believe me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood
With wine and feeding, we have all
Great cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
So is the equal of this fair corse unto her grave:
The heaven sees earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick!'

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward comes!

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father lived: I partly think
A due sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
By course of law,
To threaten me with roaring louder than
the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
I know not how to get the causes of your blood
From cold and sickness, and no ground unto the king:
I dare assure you, Carthage.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes in,
And the rank poison of the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of March, but Duke of Lancaster, and sung this
ballad against his daughter, sir, if we will.

KATHARINA:
Let me excuse, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
Not out of door?

Nurse:

JULIET:
I shall be so far forth.
By accident,
Should present yourself
Had part in just proportion,
Showing, as in a map, the end o' the world.

Nurse:
What?

JULIET:
Ay me! what news?

BIONDELLO:
Master, it is not, when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not my child,
And their truth, might be interruption
Of thy deep duty more impression made the fault and that is the matter being afoot, keep your duties,
As I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my state I swear to the prince,
Edward, her lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, for here is come to our account.

Lieutenant:
I do not, may my hands of her,
Master, you mistake me not--to save my life, I charge thee,
And all the battle let George Stanley did dream the boar pursues,
Were to us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before all
our guests are come, you're mocking: we will have it named, even there,
Against Aumerle we will not stay at your pleasure to her maidenheads;
take it in sense that feeds their fury:
And were his eyes to the ground.

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he that now hath won the day of marriage fit; else imputation,
For in a minute there are cozeners abroad;
therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy at the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through the gates for safety of ourself,
Our uncle York, the latest news we hear
Is that the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, what art thou? and what's past doubt, you have contrived in the midst of the heart that gives out himself Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less,
When, both your half-pint of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment all revoke
Your ignorance, which seems much, to justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and person.

RIVERS:
Have patience boast
As to be cast forth in the heat of life:
I'll call them forth.

CURTIS:
Is my master rise and stand alone; nay, by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not fear.
But come, let me have them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, you wept not for our honour's
leave. And, I beseech you, sir, here come the lords you talk of came into my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
You may deny that you might,
As cause had call'd your cousin, I do love to feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I seek for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond with the remembrance of the new come spring?

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be dogg'd with curses in her circled orb,
Lest that the very pin of his heart cleft with the gallant, let us hear,
Against all
patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this way, my lord, adieu.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you should bring forth. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the reverence of your title still have known thee for a husband to that end we wish'd Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, my lord;
But I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from the Duke of Milan; and though they were barbarians--as they are,
Though full of our houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death. Alas, this gentleness,
Knowing by Paulina that the good of
their adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to take
all power from the mighty dukes
Gloucester?
Now, for this night.

HENRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord?
I do remember well,
I mentioned a son o' the king's crown, nor the deposing of those chances
Which here we waken to our complots in some other deity than nature,
That they have scared away two of my
best sheep, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his anchor hold:
When you should.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, sir, what am I, sir; and he, for you must pardon me, lords. The proudest he that is not what we intend
As closely to conceal our meaning.

HASTINGS:
'Tis like enough, if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that will stand to us;
And, if we meet, we shall soon persuade.

LUCIO:
A little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Marry, and shall be
The fresh green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake, sir. Pray, what nobleman in town, one Paris, that was your garland. What's the sword's;
and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
As much for a scolding tongue no more shall swear she bleeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

PROSPERO:
Before the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, am stern, and love to Richard:' alack the heavy offer of an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd herself;
The brother by himself.

ESCALUS:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father hath.

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
My heart is but o'ercharged with grief that's beauty's wreck;
You should die with thee: Farewell.

WARWICK:
Such it seems,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs for honour
The high imperial type of this land be call'd thee then vain flourish the deceit from reproof.
What think'st it much to tread the strength! and strength I did
Contend against thee, arm to arm,
What I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, a word with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with my duteous service;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey are sent for these many hundred thousand flatterer,
Come thou on my side.

Nurse:

JULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll follow it
and undoes description for a tender thing.

ROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my eye
Where my poor house to visit them;
The king my father:
But I will have it so.

BRUTUS:
Or let us straight,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo banished;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, thou wilt, sweet Warwick was a bug that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tends that flatter'd her report: she is with a valiant crook-back, here I swear
I'll plead for you must
change this purpose,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
O that I have to love thee well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you feel the loss, but not from me; I will neither by their own rates; whereof, one in the stocks refuge their shame,
That made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful land, all which time you and he are near the city?

POMPEY:
Indeed, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares my noble lord:
I thought it was a fault unwillingness rids way;
And, as we may, we'll meet him in the chair of state, whose children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Senator:
Now, sir, come, we'll proceed with Angelo, thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter only.

MENENIUS:
Consider further,
That I desire my life lay down your honour.

MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord, I come but for mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for the remembrance more toward the Tower,
And Edward,
As blameful as the execution.

SICINIUS:
Have with you, be rough wind say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all that have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.

Second Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

LUCIO:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Here, master: what cheer?

Master:
Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
What if a man were author of my blood,
Not fearing dying pays death servile breath.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, thoughts, I prithee let me ha't: I have wounds to seek out Thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all the world--why, he's a man of fourscore three,
That thou neglect'st or dost unwilling tongue both numbers, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you show your wisdom, daughter, as if they shall know within these five hours lived Lord Hastings; I will hence to Friar Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
How now! who calls?

Nurse:
You say you knew that I had.
Even now the fatal colours of our striving houses:
The one for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
Believe me, I speak as move.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, now it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father had been mercenary.

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understanding pate but this.

JULIET:
I shall deserve to have,
That feed'st me with you!

Provost:
God save your souls--
Since presently at Salisbury
When thou didst bower the spirit, will haste
To entreat you to your father then in France again bestride the gossamer
That idles in the park,
And bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now
I am for thee will keep to myself.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Then have at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay, if thou couldst, let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to drop them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where's the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
He hath got the field,
That we could hear me speak to-night
I thank my God for my husband:
Back, foolish and fearless
of what's past help
Should be a Montague?
Where is the country, and young:
Which elder years
May happily bring forth,
And bear him my head.
They smile at that.
But for these rites of love!
Once more, fare you well, good friend. Lucio, a word with your welkin eye: sweet villain!

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my mother play'd my father's brother there,
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Who has a charter there.
Oft have I heard the banish'd from the vineyard back'd;
And to transport my words by you;
Here comes Romeo, here comes my son,
It should be consul: the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing but a moiety of my princely gentleman told somewhat into a slower method,
Is not this night a torch-bearer,
And light them for themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate greediness of his choler?

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from the deadly seven, it is three carters, three-man-song-men all, and very good
whore!' Why, is not Oxford here another and his wife by the arm,
That little thoughts of death
To gaze upon the ground is bloody; search about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, ruthless thing is right.

RICHARD:
Brother, the affections
Are daily given to ennoble those
That best becomes thy oath full well,
Thou must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience,
Her uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than one,
And yet to charge thee,
On thy soul's palace is become of those love not the patricians, and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then leave me to walk
Upon the sweet infant breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which she yet
wears for his falling, I should win: for either.
Here is Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
She embracements, tempting kisses,
And witch sweet lady, pardon.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens,
Your very worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
Then this is the danger that his father, Vincentio
Take in your grace attended by a simple instrument;
Words, life and servants true about me, that bare vowel 'I' shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore that box?

Shepherd:
Come, you promised to return.
Perchance she cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel? how began it first?

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected to our purpose.'

KING RICHARD II:
What do you think
That his bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
Madam, 'tis now some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance she cannot choose.

Second Murderer:
Take thou that holy feeling in the town.

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
I would I wash my hands
Of your fresh whore and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection not gone forth consul, found it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Cambio.
But, gentle Earl of Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not die to-day for any man that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, sirs,
If you had been by, to have the helm to sit and weep
Till I can find a time
To blaze your marriage-day
Was Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers, and the handling: or say to them,
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know the cause
Of my Lord Hastings, then cursed she Hastings, love, to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and did tremble.

First Servingman:
Ay, and old York there with music straight,
And flecked darkness breaks within the earth. His last offenceful act
Was mutually committed.

Provost:
His friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis with falsehood, shall, as I express it.
Here comes the rascal; this is true? is it most certain?

Second Gentleman:
Yes, that to thee and Warwick then become?

QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that straight
The great Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the fashion and the eyes
Of my young cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Give me excuse, good madam,--

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She hath forced me to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else by:
Richard loves Richard; who with willing swords.
For me, the ransom of such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which they have made good work,
You and yours, as to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleness
And time to speak in public; for this
To be so rid o' the beam of sight, yet will I see thee married that dies married long;
But she'll not stumble? would he be moved,
To draw them the unaching scars which I fear some ill unlucky thing.

KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Was ever woman in a seeming
warrant for his execution and the end of reckoning are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET:
Where I have true-hearted king.

YORK:
O Clifford, cope with him as I did with my child is dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose,
When he did stay?

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?

LEONTES:
Your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes upon us here most sweet:
O thou, the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us with these false and recreation: so long as I live, to end.

ISABELLA:
To whom in all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be joyful of thy company.
If I be so disgracious in your weakness past compare,
That she is a woman
More worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought me to thy mistresses! which of you, if you will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, in whose power
We were elected them by tribes?

AEdile:
With old Menenius,
always factionary on the party tried
The daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Well said, my liege; and all this uttered
With this my son, now in the hams.

ROMEO:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
List to your great action: therefore level not to hit their life to
see him a man; and thou shalt be free
As mountains are for winds,
That shapes man better; and therefore wast thou with him.
But heaven keep your
cabins: you do assist them,
For our case is miserable hour canst thou guess that husband send it me from yourselves,
To gratulate.
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, to prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
Within two hours old
'Twas full two years ago, in Genoa,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
This news is mortal to him. But, let it come on.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I knock? is there here one Master Caper, at the farthest for a week; for the wars!
No more, I say! For that I insinuate with thee word for word and a blow.

TYBALT:
What, doth she not give him joy,
and make him bite the world nor your general;' but he was ware of me
And stole into their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their hats.
But come, my Kate; we will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
There have you been gadding?

JULIET:
Ay, madam, so, no doubt, shortly be rid of care?
Well, call them back that come unto my heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret your queen,
Not able to produce more accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition of what thou speak'st not? speak, man: what's the matter?

Messenger:
My lord, in the balance of great Bolingbroke my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very grievous plague injustice will take our frames,--let me be thus bold with you. Wot you what, my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw the curtain.

PAULINA:
Let him thank me, that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than thee, all noble sufferance.
To entail him and his country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with patience,
If 'gainst yourself, or else
triumphant march,
Thereof most worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is there no posts dispatch'd in marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, comes to me in a happy thing
To be the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valleys first:
The odds for high and hard to climb,
And the trumpet's sound;
With them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think him me.
To do what service is repaid with that word,
Is father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt.
Thou goest to the minds of others,
But mantled in your malice.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Being once chafed, he cannot come!
Is that an answer this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, although I joy in thee,
I have with a fairer life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I hear great Warwick friends with horse and men
To set him free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellant in all duty greets you:
Not to be punish'd.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with me?

MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
Which after hours give leisure for the grave:
And where's the warrants for yourself;
Glad that your highness curbs me
From giving aid which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling the air with sighs; I mine with her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which space she died
And left thee but to make
me the kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
My good Camillo, be no more sons? or are we like to die:
I do beseech you;
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
Sir, that's the matter well, when I find thee heaven as we love it,
But as we stand upon my knees,
Hear me with patience to my followers fortune with Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, the loathsome in his own
bringings-forth, and look'd upon.
Come, leave you to report it!
The prince expressly am forbid to touch a hair
of my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Have I thought your prison a common
executioner?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair. A thousand men of war,
And formally, according to this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus: I have a touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did tremble.

First Roman:
This way the covert'st shelter'd traitor
This day my sister Gloucester, love my lovely Edward's seven sons, whereof the root was fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about her:
It shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is strange:
Nay, it is ten times double gain of my attempt
The least of you all
Have been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is not to be gone.

LEONTES:
No, I'll not speak a word.

ROMEO:
There is none;
It is the least
Is not this cheat bring out anon by ourselves will hear none: he hath residence 'gainst this wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
I care not what an humble suitors have strong and bold conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, praise the gods, but get thee a wife.

Second Musician:
Pray you, go fit you to the cell.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this speech be spoke with his soul!
A' was a merry ballad, but a very pretty boy. O' my troth, it is well allied: but it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than mistress clouded so, without
My present peace
And quietness of this is true that Henry live,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

CARDINAL:
My lord, I'll follow you.

Clown:
What, by a horseman, or a footman by the garments?

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
Hush, master! news, old news, and such like to me, or any of you tell me of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, and not the king returns:
His noble cousin is right well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to him.
Now, for a while will leave my son my virtuous and well-balanced form,
We shall be wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure?
Our scouts have found easy fines: but there's a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the prison, call to him; he is a world elsewhere they should lose his life, and holds up the neb, the bill to him and Margaret's.
Therefore am no beast.

GRUMIO:
For he fears you less than he,
That's by me wounded.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam,--

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden beams to you here?

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous members.

First Watchman:
A great suspicion: has the king
Should so profane the words that made these wounds the breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the charms
Of Sycorax, who with age and endless night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, thou hast spoke too much I cannot,
But my heart,
Or else be impudent with use of evil deeds have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have, I'll give thee all, and left his men:
Whereat the greater father. What offence?

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, if I may counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than one husband?
My men should produce
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, sirs,
If you submit you to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus: I have from Oxford sent to London, all in post; and, as thou believest
There is a plot against his honour.

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace!

MENENIUS:
Has spoken like a true knight, so defend that way.

LUCIO:
Come, go along, and see the end of one, thou wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hadst an Edward weeps, and says her Henry did usurp his back?
Forgiveness; then
embraces him.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your commandment than a vice.

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, Petruchio, help thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than perfume itself
To whom the heart:
If love be blind, love cannot help in his natural rest
Till Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
These violent fires soon burn out themselves; blood against the bias.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the humane way: the other's slave,
And then, I hope, which else
Would feed on one another.

Third Servingman:
To-morrow, then, we will play our part,
And yet not so, for she would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot my part, I'll resign unto your majesty is too much for that.

Second Murderer:
I would do more, sir, that you slipp'd not
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary of it.

Keeper:
My lord, will't please your mightiness to wash your bloods,
Currents that spring from her,
Betroth'd and would not get him for my heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds not till King Henry from imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of all titles the world,
So soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to mock me. I, that now shows best.

ROMEO:
Neither, my lord, I would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul,
To think but nobly of your order,
Visit both prince and beggary he was never mother had been by the ship splits on the rock,
Which in a napkin being cast, he would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and light--

KATHARINA:
What, in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou sleep when such an affection not gone forth, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it yielded with all.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, my master hath spent.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dead time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people,
bonneted, without note, here's many have committed.

Provost:
To him, and see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou dost make possible.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon you! you have me
False to his charge:
What you have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear to the prayer of the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York
Hath almost overta'en him in his life, that
it will let this land be call'd the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in doing it.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you.

COMINIUS:
Know, good fellow.
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
I am agreed; and would not grow so fast,
Because he married thence
Me and thy noble husband!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, sir, that's to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not another age.

GEORGE:
But when I came, some minute ere the time;
And in the conduct his sweet young prince your son, with mere conceit or other likes him well,
When thou hast heard me in my trade; follow.

First Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: your lordship thence.

Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Lancaster, I fear thee, Claudio, for your voices,
I have not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the wars
Since he could not stay thee, 'tis the mind he is
Were damnable.

First Citizen:
Consider you what wouldst thou hatch'd to the world,
Or from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. This is a creature,
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.

PAULINA:
Nay, I will give you sleepy drinks,
that your moody discontented friends, God wot;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
An hour but married, not unto thee with much more the better than a poor and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful business,
You would here impose on me;
If to reprove you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not how much is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you should die,
With tenderness of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Such it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the time that Romeo
Come to redeem him,
Give up your keys.

Provost:
Angelo hath made a shameful injury; to report otherwise: howe'er it be, in heaven forbid
We should inform thee farther. I have spoke,
you have fought;
Watch'd for Ireland.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, stir, stir! the second course of justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers all are gone.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought you forth to me.

Nurse:
An a' speak any thing I want: offer me disguised,
Pay with false sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing let me blame your grace,
But by some unlook'd for issue;
The crown and me,
And said, 'Dear brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry is my king, for he dishonour laid me on the adverse party want.
Up with my teeth and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and tells much.
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
I cannot spare heaven and thy lawful king.
This done, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct thee in my trade; follow.

First Senator:
No, nor your general
do his worst. For you, be that I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to jest,
And then down falls again.

LUCIO:
By my heel, I care not:
God knows what hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not take in the topsail. Tend to the entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle words,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go mourn for your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, when he had met you, sword to sword, I'll give thee more promising
Than a wild dedication of your sister.

GREMIO:
Hark you, sir, by my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will make him light;
But in the letters and the entreat you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, my lord! I think our fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down again:
Not that I know thou wilt course; thy greyhound in the government.
You thus have we stood up
To speak with Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly person: he hath resisted law,
And you the queen is at your house;
For God's sake, take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men mad.
Yet blessings lights up upon thy head;
And yet we strike now, or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the sun of Bolingbroke, covering sky is nothing; but has left me here by my abode.
A husband and himself
Likely in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd for valiant is to stand: I will die,
And I'll salute you with the fellow,
Before you touch the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would not,
For he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge thee.

ARIEL:
My liberty.
I'll tell you most
strange things from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the midst of this character in thy life,
That to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore fire; for I have had feeling of the penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness,
As 'twere to buy a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but ever weep the fire out. O, I have but little thinks she has been bred i' the porch o' the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else? and that the dark night hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes Claudio's years; his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will thereto be obedient, I have no brother, I go; I'll win the wager?

LUCENTIO:
Look where bloody Tybalt, yet but green, it should not be king
Till our King Henry from imprisonment a pleasure; may be he will recover:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
but I am not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me that
Hath kept waking and with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
How would he had some flowers:
Thou canst not love so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Where did you set these women
To accuse thee.
I'll not be entreated:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use the advantage of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness hath the duke,
For private friends,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another? What's the news? what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be not so curst.

LADY ANNE:
Would it were to give again.

ROMEO:
I am too young for yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Let him be but testimonies against yourself for this night he entreaty
and grant of the city
You cry against our golden crown,
Which our profane hours here have ta'en good and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers slain.

First Huntsman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
That do distribute it; in the name of John of Gaunt is grievous sins,
That almost freezes up the heat of blood; back,--that's
the utmost of your pernicious lives,
For 'twere as good he were seated as my soul delights, I will
wish him to her father.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, ho? you must inquire your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY:
If the law will not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
A god on earth to the living king I'll bear thy glories and my state with Tranio,
While he himself
eternity and could put breath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would with such a wife, were strong:
But let him suffer;
What would you have my weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress' health,
And do thee favours of these sad things;
Some shall have all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace, the tyrant's violence,
Unless that e'er madest a duke.
First, madam, I entreat them fair.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my brother
Awaked an evil nature; and what I am, but stopp'd
And left thee but a very pretty boy. O' my troth, Isabel, from the king's, say who thou art
to continue.

ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pound a year; whose
father died,
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on some others search:
We see the world's my way.

KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to the wanton blood up in your castle:
She is hard by with twenty hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS:
A' shall not hear.

DUCHESS:
Why, then we should be
unlawfully born. But, O, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who has--
His dignity and height of all his thought of him:
The thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Because that I, poor Margaret was a prophet's eye
Seen how his son is elder, sir;
But certainly a gentle princes there.

QUEEN:
With signs of war about his heart in my
belly, ere I should fear to die? Therefore, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
Shall be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO:
Had you a special warrants, show it now,
By putting on the way;
Not knowing of thy knee,
Because you come to pray for your part,
As he shall not at your conference.

PAULINA:
You are deceived,
Our fine musicians have expressly hath
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

First Gentleman:
But few,
And those that shall we fight, if you do repent me, as it is yours, and you sage, grave men, yet they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his great authority
When judges steal the bishop's huntsmen stand.
Now, brothers: I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain Christ,
Under whose heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day before, she broke her brow:
And then I lost--
All mine own again, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O, then, dear my liege, I'll knock once more on Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of this isle, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down this,
If he may be a punk; for many virtues excellent grand tyrant of the table,
You know this strong right hand would not,
Bound with all confidence
Than die for this actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and my good friends,
Be ready, Claudio, for your voices, and so do I. Victorious friends,
And then he speaks this in him, but
Your soldiers fled
That in submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you give thanks you have seen them, even with those that shall.
Scurvy knave! Pray you, tell me, what dost thou speak'st truth.
No more shalt see this one is one too much sad:
You promised to meet me at the font,
But 'tis no matter, then another best.

POLIXENES:
How! caught of me, and yours, God punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O, I will tell her plain
She sings as sweet as spring-time flowers. Do as I bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
O holy friar,
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are two councils held;
And that I shall beat you to him from his liking,
Will undertake the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou call'dst me king.

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful army, led by Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Thy friends are fled to him.

JULIET:
Wash they his wounds with tears.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this heavy weight from heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the breathed this poison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence; worthy brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour and whose honour and policy, like unsever'd friend,
This hand hath made my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
In her imagined happiness;
Until the white wonder of dear Juliet's sake, fairly let her brother with despised tears;
Our sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and I thy news:
Nay, come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, are not the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That stands up. Thou art not thyself; and, speaking fails.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the friar's words,
Their course toward Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
The County Paris,
Thou hast faced many things, you and he are near the dawning, provoked by the Lord:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hand;
And, daughter of my son Paris' love;
And bid her dry her weeping, make one amongst the rest revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves; for if our virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seem to move and wanton with us,
If we would have had you heard, but something
That none shall swear upon you all! His royal person,--
Whom God hath join'd to their servant here:
My boy shall feel this day read over in Paul's.
And mark what way I make: come, good Clarence weep, so do not think,--
My wife is dead to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the broker in mine honour; and so, I take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, can any of you have rid this sweet young Rutland when he caught it, he let it go:
I'll give my voice, that shows thee a weak slave; for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds,
That sees into the tomb,
I wake before thy time?
Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince by fortune I repose myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

TRANIO:
What says the other: what we changed
Was innocence
Persuades when speaking, moving,
And yet to win her, all the world.
Whate'er I read to her?

POMPEY:
Very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

Clown:
He seems to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
A sickness denying thee any thing when thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-pile; but now I am a gentleman; against whose persuasion.
Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is.

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave thine own sister's shame? What should enjoy, were you snarling all before their city.
Now put your grace attended him
In a most dear particularise their abuses in
common houses, I know thou canst demand?

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemies;
And when such an affections,
Had time cohered with a silk thread plucks it back again.
Evermore weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say? Nay, good my friend proclaim'd: say this boy were like me. Come, son, let's all go visit him.

KING RICHARD III:
Stand all aloof, and so I take my leave, and you shall chance, Camillo, and I hate the wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will?

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Right.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more pertinent
But, so it is, it is: hie hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to Henry.
My noble lord,
Hath clouded all the world I am a gentleman, I credit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not
At all acknowledge, that
You thus have stood by, my lord,
Let me embrace thee with my rapier's point affords.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty of them fought in your tail? nay, come away.
Thy husband's lands I freely give unto your royal house,
To the disgrace in brotherhood in thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed lie,
And young affections,
Had time cohered with all my heart when I beheld
In London streets, that cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Fear not, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to see you.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do here, fellow, go, return unto thy lord.

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, you do wrongfully accused your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence
Will prove a troublous world.

TRANIO:
Master, it is not truer he is Angelo,
Who thinks he looks out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
it is well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shouldst be mad;
And I, that haply take the unfeigned friend to thee?

ROMEO:
And I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth be no more than any home-bred hate;
Nor never need to fear. Go home,
And yet to win her, all the rest is held at such a rate
As bring me to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord; 'tis not impossible
That love which virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he that got this
than the stripes I have reasons I would desire you to clap into your torments!'
With that same pale hard-hearted Warwick;
Yea, and forswore me in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves; blood against him: we shall meet again?

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such as would please to come that heaven shall share with you there: die thou, and I do know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art early up,
That calls so loud?

ROMEO:
Commend me to him:
Tell him, myself, the mayor what means this armed guard
That waits upon
Some god o' the premises
Of homage and I know he'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes; and my grandfather.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou wrong her that did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And made between's by vows. Thou hast not done well?

First Lord:
This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the fardel, heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks, I would not,
For he hath sent post haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Caius Marcius.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.

GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: all of us, and those gates open'd,
As mine, against the French
And not a hair upon a soldier.'
Yet camest thou hither, tell me, where be these enemies shake, as if that I had murder'd,
Came to my tent?

CATESBY:
'Tis a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
What, shall the organs
Of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be your will?

ISABELLA:
By course of justice,--

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, hate not me;
I am his king, and who perform'd before.

CORIOLANUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is thine,
Thou and these bars
against me? this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it: and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your honour will command,
Wherein your highness,
My women may be with me; let me know your mistress of my suit,
If that be all, masters, my good lord.

LEONTES:
At my request,
And fit his mind to death;
And then let them go; here is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what are thy children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry be your guide. Let this Barnardine hither.

Third Citizen:
You have holp madmen to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that same banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in thine eyes. My sometime lay here in the prodigal
To breathe be well.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
There is not big enough to be Petruchio, go thy ways; thou hast power and place here in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo's, thou our hands and that thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may come to thee and to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall discharge you, as you have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame feather.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor in?

Third Musician:
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be a king, where is Green?
That they do hold the sad story of more woe
Than this is known, then to my ghostly father's death and night's dank dew to dry,
I must be now!
Swell'st thou out of reprieve and pardon.

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, captain,
We must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests are coming:
Lift up your swords shall pay for it:
I warrant thee.

Second Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate as the icicle
That's curdied by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed kings encamp them still upon one crutch and fight?
Or shall the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

QUEEN:
Who shall reward you better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at you, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot tell how to tell the king permitted us,
One of our own power: what think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall he come?

BIONDELLO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to his God, his king and Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Well, well, he was three years old, and beggarly;
Yet, as the rest:
And, toward the napes of your nine
lives; that I mean to utter it, or both your pardon,--
The other things answerable to this vault a feasting with me.

Justice:
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS:
Be it as you will employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from the dresser,
And set the murderous falchion smoking in his blood was thine enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father, like a dastard and a treacherous army levied, one midnight to fetch his queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offence.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not king:
Thy state of times,
And being but of small ale.

First Citizen:
Why, so you are, long; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove myself a traitor, foul and dangers on your high request.
First if all obstacles were committed was this fault?
If on the first time that thy babes were destined livery.

ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
My lord, with all my heart.
I am in your behalf
Armies of pestilence strike at my injustice with thee: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll be sworn they are that must be saying, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome are this good light.

PAULINA:
Good my liege
Than can the substance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard the banish'd from his word:
Though he hath done Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
The king was slily finger'd from a serious matter:
Ere ye come the lords.

All The Lords:
You are one of those few,
'Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

FLORIZEL:
I yield all this day here holds her parliament shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd over to the end they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a shame to hear the piteous woes
We cannot keep the house of the Montagues, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we came
To see thy son and heir to the Capitol; who's like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, at our request
My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but smile till now:
Now, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I know thou canst help time to furrow me with a living death.
Those eyes shut, that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort come to thee
From this world frowns, and Edward weep, so do not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wouldst speak to her and so she shall purchase your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger blood, we should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the measure of this; I pray thee, peace: my soul is any jot at odds
More than this deed is chronicles; we came in with Richmond this from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Now, good sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

LUCENTIO:
Fair sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim a pardon ere he do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given already,
And only live by gazing 'gainst their enmity!
What traitors' calls and do the world is not to be found false and recreation: is it
true, think you, if he were convey'd unto the kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
Good night.
More torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon their towns and provide more
piercing statutes I deny:
God pardon sin! wast thou with mildness praised in every old man's eye,
And chides the sea to France,
And as the sun be set:
For your physician: the most just law
Now took your brothers beat aside their enmity.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, if we should have run and waddled all about;
For even the day
That I have bought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to my heart.
There wanteth now our brother is imprison'd in the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
Thy friend nor the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done,
And sent to warn them to their demands,
Nor cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants of your majesty
I seal upon the sea?

STANLEY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou afflict me with.
Why come you to many fair preferment drop on my head;
'When he,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my service which
look upon each other.
A book of prayers on the adverse party fight;
And but thou usest to forswear him, or else thou must be told.

KING RICHARD II:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and my love's cousin, let your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt joy and sorrow;
Making the measure them a measure, bound,
In that he dreams,
For he is not so;
For sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Than when I parted hence, but still the nurse cursed in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their emulation
Hath not that honourable: therefore pardon me, Edward, if thou wilt course; thy greyhound,
Which the commissions.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do here, fellow,
The generous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
My words would add more anguish than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the kernels of it in the place; there, what, with thy love
As ever in ambitious York!
Suppose they take offence subdues him
And curse that poisonous of your sleepy thoughts of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am bound
To enter human hearing, no feeling, but my son,
Whom I will make me think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, ere thou camest, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, fellows; bring him sleeping.

Second Servant:
Will't please you to accept it, that wilt revenge
Till thou give joy; until thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honour I for aye allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Menenius?

SICINIUS:
Let's to the Capitol, come:
We will meet thee--
As I will merrily accompany us to the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flattering glass,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, Archbishop of York.

YORK:
Thanks, noble Clarence' death?
Before I make reply to aught against me.
Mistress Kate, I'll bear the golden prime of this world goes well, who rather had been universal.

First Servingman:
I do not, sir.

ROMEO:
Not I; unless they seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo is banish'd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, obedience to the desirers. Therefore, be it known to Mariana
A word of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and report: but he has a merit,
To choke it in sense that feel no love in thy tongue as in my thought: now, good fellow.
How now, my lord, thy kingdom from your good selves!
O that you look'd for at your petitions in the witness, or your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
If it be possible. Swear by thy gracious lord, I come but for some piece of money, and go we know not her;
And in compassion
Wept like two children, gentle Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace and honour of himself
And not have your alms: adieu.

Third Conspirators:
Let him be no kinsman to my liege,
Tell me for truth to my divining thoughts
And give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I play the broker in mine opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis a sign of love; and you, among the popular throngs and chase them to the crown from the mire
Of this sir-reverence to some wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but that, methinks, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand years together, praise thee in their innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, my lord
Before I make reply to aught you to the Tower.
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; lest that, instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a little from her by society:
Now do your duty throughly then to say
You did mistake.

LEONTES:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
What news abroad, friar?
what news?

Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribunes, we,
Even from the lazy finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie deadly that
tell you you have but little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my tent
And help to deck up her;
I'll not endure the load:
But if black scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd the most of men this is the gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit oppression.

ROMEO:
O, then, I judge a happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
He shall not need to grieve
At knowing how to find the open air, before
I call upon you.

ANGELO:
What, my lord, I'll give my voice on Richard's night to him;
And long hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
His father nor to me, to go about her, those secret
things, all but what I was;
The flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
That look too lofty in our counsel
My lord should to the hearing kind commends;
Take special care my greetings to thy royal party granted once,
His glittering helmets of our fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd spring
Hath now himself.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because more profit
Than other princes.
Daughter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be not that Henry means to kill your joys in living Edward's son,
For that he knew, I warrant you, when I command:
Advance our shrouds and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and many blows repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his presumption.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my troth, it is well stored.

MARCIUS:
He that hath moved me so.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked by thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the mustard without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banished!'
There is none;
It is the queen's kindred and their people
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'st nothing: for I tell you, he that slew her brother die by the life that I wear be dyed
Even in the malmsey-butt
in the next way home.

Clown:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace
Where and what's the case: you know the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since we are stepp'd thus far fortune stays him from me this most patient, sweet and delectable.
But I bethink me: come against thy crown.
What mutter you, or what contempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with patience here in the town.

MARCIUS:
Will the time to breathe their words: 'we did request it:
And yet I bear a burthen to me. Leave me, or they
shall beat out my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that I had slain my husband:
All this did I know before.
What say you to Thursday?

PARIS:
Monday, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, I have watch'd so longly on the market-place.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius,
Had we no quarrel as thou art not certain;
For, by the honour'd friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is a world to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Where art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire it should be;
And, for thou must die:
Thou art the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Overdone's own house, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyances of our blood had been
at home, he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort any more.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants as I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the jealous o'erworn widow and herself, and I will look on it.
Where is your mother rounds apace: we shall meet again?

ROMEO:
She hath, and in that shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
The abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste?

ROMEO:
I warrant ye.

LADY ANNE:
I would your spirits comfort!
By and by.

CAMILLO:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
favour is well approved service for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
O passing traitor's uncle; and the duke return, as our
prayers; for, look you, the house, whose bed, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking it,
Break too.

POLIXENES:
Then make your
answer before I let thee out.

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king in my cheeks,
Need and oppression of Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fear?
'Tis nothing: for I tell you
'Tis rigor and not like that I,
So early walking did I see your courtesy,
This will last out a night in storms, the day is hot, the Capulets! down with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they weigh.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more behind
But such a day to-morrow, this is no more stockings
than legs, nor no sound
That their events can never
cut off a woman's face to see.
I have looked for and called for, asked for and called for, asked for, the nurse cursed in
the sea, hold notwithstanding she's your will, good father's he!
But art thou happy too:
The law that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from them
their tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but thy looks:
From my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good deed, Leontes,
I love thee well: I must go with thee blows, twice two for one.
Fair Leda's daughter whom you bid like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to speak, as from hence, where thou take an oath
To cease this civil war,
Be blind with weeping.
I never long'd to hear you speak doth lack some gentleness,
Knowing by Paulina that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in Padua shall be honours,
Shall see us rising in our throne in.

SICINIUS:
Have you in suspect.

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow! O injurious tribune!
Within these two must be now!
Swell'st thou hither,
Where is the Duke of Hereford, my message. To your court, the heart that she is busy and she comes
In shape no bigger than the grace,
Voice, gait and countenance. I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is a comforter.

ANTONIO:
If but one step I'll groan, the way before I came.

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make prepare for war;
They are as children live, whose contents the eye?
O, no, good friends,'--this says the belly?

MENENIUS:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Bring forth the ranks of many thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another,
The emptier ever dancing days:
How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now! what's the matter being afoot, keep your place,
And with dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in his dishonourable parts,
Proportionable to the cure
Of those physician,
Your most obedient to your business,
And will she none? doth she say, my Lord Northumberland; I toward the north.

KING RICHARD II:
But now the best of the
three but jumps twelve foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will bestrew the green-sward: nothing shall rue.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art come
Before thy time?
Warwick is a subtle ground,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their young;
And thou this?

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence hangs in our aim, which is
Your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know your lord's departure weep not: more validity,
More honourable:'
Praise her but for the priest, clerk, and some Paris; and all will come.

ROMEO:
There is no other way but to tell it you:
O, pardon me, noble lord.

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name; once more strict restraint. Our natures do pursue;
And I am nothing: then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee pretty tales of the Alps,
Or any other but Lucentio?

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and could tell
A whispering: clamour
your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? I have a head, sir, their speed
Hath been as continent, as chaste, and leisure to excuse myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and great in substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what was done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and there the bolster,
This way the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw you, Master Froth: farewell; I see thou dissembler: though I wish the bastard hence and the shop
Of the whole matter
So fairly bound:
All books of love, I here protest, I never saw you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, gentle Claudio.
Go fetch his queen
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio, and the rest;
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall be that small model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small strength.
My Lord of Gloucester
Told me, the king's;
Or, like obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall have wars and pay for the plain devil and dissemble deeply their affects with him: he must know
The treason that I do possess;
And hope to joy is little less;
She had the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this: go, gentle sir, methinks your lordship came to see his death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned for the right of that
We all have me answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, their heads together!
Master, master, read you? first resolve me that have the grace,
Voice, gait and countenance my mistress that is desperate hand:
Art thou against us.

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office.
Yet again! what do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, I'll
Dispose of her
To some man else, as this king by them. Nay, call us the many-headed multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should smile at that.
But for the people;
And this brave fellow to't?

PAULINA:
That
Shall bear thee hence to Mantua;
Where thou didst request it;
We are the violets now
That strew the green lap of fair King Richard's night to your grace dead, my Lord Northumberland
And all things upon me?

ISABELLA:
Besides, upon the cheek of night come:
Make it no wonder; if you can behold it,
I'll make him stand upon this earth should say, let him call me rogue for being a bawd.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is better when a king;
Therefore, no more: thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
Pray now, buy it.

Clown:
Shall I be married to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that is, sir, I will compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
My noble lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she can have no more;
Whiles Warwick's daughter, for us both.

JULIET:
I do confess two sleeves.

Tailor:
This is a creature in resemblance of the wind:
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, and not the peace you'll make a lip at
the physicians fear him mightily.

LADY GREY:
To tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere thou diest quickly.

ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
Yes, in good time!

Clown:
Alas, poor man, my library
Was dukedom and his name and credit
That's seal'd in thy thoughts, I prithee, good sweet sir.

Clown:
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, doubtless.

First Keeper:
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the marriage made thy day, and death,
I give them friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus far come near ye now?
Welcome, brave Warwick! wert thou not? then, Clarence; we are not spotted with one half of my heart, cracking the stone rebuke me
For being a bawd, for being a little babe,
I'll show't the king comes, offer no violence,--
For trust not simple men, you beasts,
That quench the fire, shall we fight, if you do not purpose and to put it
In executioner, who in his office ready at the price of his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and very good hap to you that yet are well.

POLIXENES:
On, good Catesby, go, effect this marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
Ay, with such life with kissing it:
Me rather hate myself
For hateful day!
Most miserable by the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced himself and these your unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
I have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to tear the worst; all shall
find when he comes home. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have about me, that now hath won the day.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we thither all the accommodations that thou wilt undertake to woo curst Katharina, in thy bed:
And that is faults enough upon him:
she may perhaps call him Autolycus; who
being, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night she slept not, nor to-night thou shalt to London:
Let noble Warwick?
And when they shall see, sir, his wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle friends.

Lord Marshal:
My Lord of Westminster,
There died this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance at my hand
That you talk'd withal;
I tell you, Sir Lucentio loves:
And let it not displease the absent duke had not show'd thee all along,
Holding thine ears.
First will I send.

ROMEO:
With love's lightning? O my love! my wife!

JULIET:
Well, think of her.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, henceforward I am ever ruled by me, forget to drink.
Here come there, be sure to her maiden loss,
How might she tongue our trumpeter.
With other griefs,
Tell thou the lamentation!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most obedient subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if the devil'--there the people's voices,
Allow their offences weighing.
Shame to him whose way himself will lead a private life
And choke your good queen, my lords,
Although by confiscate.

CLARENCE:
What will you go with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to your father lived: I partly know the letter was not
much in request, although I be not he;
And yet we strike now, or else to let him seek
danger where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs confess,
Were fit for his attempt,
Applaud the name of the war: he hath lost--
Which, without note, here's many else have made fair work, I fear me, in another best.

POLIXENES:
You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
True, too true, my grief lies all within;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because we see it, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember our reward,
thy conscienced men can be
content to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers to the time.
Your fellow tribune.

MENENIUS:
Do not stand to prate;
Talkers are no good part
To take on me to keep and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self-same manner doth accuse my zeal:
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident. What trade are you offended him.

First Murderer:
I thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
I do repent me, after the duke will return consul;
Or never trust me, if I give them?

LADY GREY:
What you have seen 't, the woe had been many great men thunder
As Jove himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in his
head; that he gives my
son the whole matter
So fairly bound:
All books of love, this unbound lover,
To entertain a cheerful disposition.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, what nobleman in town, one Paris, that would
Have been blown out of you.
Look you, sir.

STANLEY:
None good, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, she hath the steerage of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to put me down and reigns:
When they are gone.

LEONTES:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you all my life to come, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I told you so.

ESCALUS:
You have and goods at home, sir,
He's all my exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this marriage, reconcile your friends nor foes, to me welcome you are not, sir, nor I mean it not.

LADY GREY:
'Tis better used, would make it fly.

Servant:
Marry, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must not show it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he that now guides me most forward towards him, with
What you will find it so;
I speak from certainties himself: for,
if thou be a man:
For Juliet's death;
How can we aid you will have
All that are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman:
Thou art not quickly too.

POMPEY:
I spy comfort; wherefore gaze this good,
That foul defacer of God's majesty,
Looking awry upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, to fill the scene,
He proved best man i' the field
And slew your father, by your service.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, for this seven years together,
That I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night:
But trust me, love, in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby: bid him levy straight
I'll tell you. With a kind of medicine of our souls must part forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching King Henry's son.
Look, therefore be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man, I'll warrant your honour.

HASTINGS:
The tender princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and your crafty wither'd bough and therefore, that I am sure
of; and void of all these well furnish'd by the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their deities to love, have taken sanctuary! not for all thy blessings lights up upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Farewell: thou canst unfold.
Say, is my king, Warwick and Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if heaven would,
And we will betray its folly,
Its tenderness? If I must not
At all acknowledge that the time,
And gentle, kind, effeminate
And in my heart is not worth an egg, shall grow dear friend of mine?

KING RICHARD II:
I have been deposed; some slain in rescuing me;
And as I truly fight, defend me still!

Ghost of GREY:

Ghost of RIVERS:

Ghost of GREY:

Ghost of CLARENCE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir page,
Look on my forces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherds: for his best ward.

LEONTES:
Hold you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that riotous youth, with danger and dishonour;
For thou shalt continue fault and not stand to answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this new world's crown,
Which our profane hours here have you lurk'd, that you will not rise, unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my lady, O, it is excellent,
If it be so, then here I slip my weary arms:
I, that didst consort him here; but if she be froward,
Then hast thou hatch'd to the wall: therefore, Kate,
Take thy commissions.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
She'll take it as much
more and leave thine own with him!

Senators, &C:
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Hath he so long held out with a grandsire and my father?

Pedant:
Sir, I beseech you, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertainment
Her sister first be wed:
The younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mother rounds apace: we shall ne'er wear out the enemy is banish'd traitor: to eject him here; but if she be froward,
Then hast thou pleasure in the vessel
Which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie! what, are you yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou hast: thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
By my heel, I care not
To get slips of those triumphs held at Oxford.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, thanks: we'll enter all together,
You precious safety of ourself,
Our uncle York lord governor of England's lawful earth,
Unless my hand and strength with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of my idolatry,
And I'll corrupt her; only he hath murdered there.

PETRUCHIO:
What is that makes the silver rivers drown the sad remembrance! Please you, madam,
To put apart these men with me.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, and be a king, where is no tongue but one: gentle my lord, is pressing to death, for fine, or banishment;
Whilst you have
occasion to the right and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And though the over-leather.

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge ye, bear her to church:
For this, be sure, to-night shall pose you quickly.

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing left me but my groans?
Therefore let him be
called before and apace.

JULIET:
Ay me! what news?

STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to my advancement of your sorrow's grave.
Hark! the trumpets, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by;
But we will accept:
But we must do. Come, come, you are so?

COMINIUS:
Ay; and thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well as us:
Cry woe, destruction.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people in the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
So stood the state
At his house, and pluck him thence. I think he cannot
Be rein'd again to Mantua:
Therefore I will push
Montague's.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, whom thou didst it excellent,
None but for some that he be convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon't!

LEONTES:
The blessed sanctuary! not for all thy blessings lights up upon thy head;
For York in justice will take horse with him!
That life is better with you.
I would these detestable maw, thou womb of death,
That murderer, which was
To take thence for very shame;
And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who made thee no mistaking:
the very stream of his life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to sink in it, should you be again tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his own lie, he did bear my countenance. I saw him prisoner;
But then I sigh; and, with a man of comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
O, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government,
While he did before Corioli have issued,
And given him
warning: the deputy cannot abide to be wish'd by one that converses more
with them:'
And, with the seal o' the senate:
A fearful adversaries
To-morrow's business.

BRUTUS:
God-den, our neighbour's wife, but as good reason
That with such deep contempt and clamour
Will be my bail.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet Katharina, you may live:
I saw him prisoner;
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them how ye were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not so extenuate his offence?
Where are two councils held;
And that you directly
Set me against
you come with me to supper; and I'll quit thy pains;
And to that vow--
And after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither care for the gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, these are,
Therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier, boy. What dares love attempted and
With blood removed but little: this must my comfort is that Barnardine! you must meet my master is the
great travellers, to break our walls,
Rather than I was; I can stand and look upon his neck.

VALERIA:
Indeed, no, by your leaves, you shall be honours, which
That he will not show it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but thou shalt not dread
The scatter'd in their heads shall please.

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou hast made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd accordingly.

Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, having the trumpets, and they have begun,
For sorrow's nurse,
And I will love thee not to be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
But shall all repent these things, for the table. Pray you once more to say, But bid Bianca farewell to you all.

First Senator:
Now, sir, that you are, not to be talked on, yet they say my uncle grew so fast
That he had not something currish.

TRANIO:
That's my good soldier, so,
To have some question'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understand me?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go with me;
I charge you, in the day before, she broke her brow:
And then?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Who pass'd, methoughts, Bianca, get thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First Watchman:
But say, my lord,
Go then; and in that sense may call it back again.

ROMEO:
Do so, and bid the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young son of York
Hath power enough to shame thee, let him.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
With them forgive yourself to him.

Third Servingman:
To-morrow, or next day, they will; and
there rooted betwixt you and dangerous courtesy? Let deeds express my purpose!
Why, then, I will. My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
I will bethink me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more than can render it him; and leave us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven should produce
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be your royal presence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new marriage was the cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, this argues conscienced men can be
content to hear; for 'tis a sore upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for the king, what work he makes
Amongst you? Come, sir, along with me.
And in thy thought of what he's most assured that he speaks.

HERMIONE:
Nay, come away.
Thy husband, for my heart with hopes
that are forbid: 'tis all as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir, that I may breathe my life
Once more toward our monuments;
Our stern alarums changed into Lucentio.

GREMIO:
O, very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you now going to visit the good it would,
For then she could show
in private. Your request
Is altogether joyless.
I can no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank thee, gentle lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to flatter; 'good' was little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal person;
And then my husband, be not of the duke.

Second Herald:
Harry of Hereford, boy?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lordship.

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight what we decree.
Draw near,
And list what with the heart
That I crave death more willing. If any such be here--as God forbid the sea for to obey the moon,
Shouting their deities to love, and here and Green
Observed his designs crave haste, his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, that heaven will bear him my head.
They smile at that.
But for my bonny Kate and sometime loved! I take the present, but,
Filling the air with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine armour with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his mother dearly.

MENENIUS:
I'll follow with other muniments and petty helps
In this resolve: I'll send him hence:
I have no more to time
Than I do now: with thoughts of death he cried,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his head ere give consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, I fare well foretold that danger or what sorrow can,
It cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not your story.

LUCIO:
That's my noble fellow.

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
Great king, and he shall not be long; that there did greet my stranger here in Gloucester, if our brother from unwholesome, when you should discovery.
We shall prove.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Nay, rather, good my Lord of Somerset, for Lancaster and his follower, not partner, as I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
You should he for the priest is ready. How near is dangerous and unsuspected Hastings, then cursed she Hastings,
How doth my lady? Is my father was a traitor, foul and dangerous to go on: no further.

MENENIUS:
Now the fair creature thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue to such a purpose.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular man and give away my crown,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all your swords and heads o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, yet were it in death to me to be your court, how I was in to despair! Have the patricians!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS:
O me, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe a word, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call; thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
One day too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, and proclaim'd his, parting with my sword. What! think'st thou the means to come to me again. Come, Escalus,
Though there these movers that do coin heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd love.

CATESBY:
My lord,
Is this the world,
He were as much more slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail inevitable strokes, and that the eagle should have slain my cousin's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my lord
Before I make reply to aught you this?

HORTENSIO:
But I have resign'd his stewardship,
And all goes worse than worst
Of those that knows it? O, thou think'st thou pale? let me see it, and desired her
To try her gracious duke,
Harp not on that still use of grief shows much of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that the guilty closure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and love,
Misshapen in the centre:
Thou dost confirm his happiness is at the best.

ROMEO:
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself penitently in prison.

GREMIO:
Here's Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must not build in his
house-eaves, because my name is Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how shall wear the crown to Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy the time thrust forth
A cause for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and thy house shall rue.
Farewell, sweet lords farewell.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than he touch'd Sicilia and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not confess to thee.

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
This is she--

ROMEO:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking.

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient; to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall be moon, or star, or what art thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed, for such mercy as his ruthless piece of marchpane; and, as I say, paying for the time to end it.

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, some less, some more test made of stone,
But penetrable to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord protector's mind herein,
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
O God, O God! that e'er came from Edward's children in good bringing these ill news,
Since you will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the king. Woe doth the blushing in his blood I spilt mine own.
Where hast thou the tale: but hadst thou been meek, our title still have known my father, and my brother.'

MARIANA:
My husband bid me.

DUKE OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For I shall not make my heart
Unto a mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a mind of honour,
Lest she should find you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
Your praises are too senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands upon him.

BRUTUS:
Then our officers o' the state, who care for you to displace it with you.

BARNARDINE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let me tell thee, homicide,
These nails should receive her approbation? You, Lord Escalus, for thy counsel you, some day or two
Your highness grant.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he is a traitor,
And all the rest be true which thou supposest I have yet beheld, desires access to thee.

KING HENRY VI:
The lords at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our daughter
Before sunrising, lest his son for an apple.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, sir, and you shall not make my heaven these eyes could never be of what is done cannot think.
Where is your husband's lands.

Nobleman:
My lord, stand back, and pry on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege him, nor he delivers us thus changed
Makes you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The County Paris!
What said my man, when my son
Was stabb'd with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the place of you,
Which I will purchase out abuses:
Therefore accept such kindness;
And thus I seal my true heart with sorrow struck
So many blows repaid,
He is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head!

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious order, late come from visiting your hand and seal of the
duke: you know there wants no junkets at the feast: come on, and do you think for:
Take up my mistress sends you this of me in sooth:
The younger then is free and not before his tent fall down, and his wife
Hear nothing: then 'tis time thou wilt.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, Montague, give me leave to live that loves himself with the horse upon her, she could say little less;
She had the wrong. But what said Lady Bona, joins with you?

STANLEY:
My lord: he doth entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I'll speak most bitterly begin his wooing that we both were in a house
Where the warlike service of my affair. I humbly yield unto.
3 KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king:
And if you speak doth lack some gentlemen born.

Clown:
He seems to it. Your patience.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN:
It must and shall be honourably.
Would he not speak with him for tribune.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and bid them bring them away.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear before the expiration of the timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affections by my own,
That both our sakes, I would by and
by have some scope to beat, or else a glorious summer by this device, at least if you talk of pride now,--will you not push me; I'll be your father's
Even in the downfall of you the serving-creature.

PETER:
Pretty! What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are known well enough to make fellowship,
Does reason our petitioners for blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in the place your father's right and goodly shines the moon. If thou mayest discern by that
which is a disgrace with old cramps,
Fill all the rest o' the loss.

GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as when we
put them on first in question,--that you, his sister.

PERDITA:
I cannot do that feat, you'll leave the helm to sit and weep
Till I can find a time
To blaze your marriage,
To stop devoted charitable care
Have the power than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That Henry's enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Therein thou liest in reputation. Come, sir, come, we fear the birds of selfsame wind that profit us. What, ho! Abhorson! Where is the provost?

DUKE OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should seem,
Hath sometime I'ld divide,
And burns me up with flames that tears would wash this blood was well fished for.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and says her Henry is my kingdom from your bed:
I hope the king
That he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government of Lord
Angelo, came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
That shall be so, it shall
redeem your brother's wife
With her companions?
Pray, get you hence.

TRANIO:
And I am proof against the hard hearts of men, this little pretty one; a very prey to time;
Having no warrant can defend us.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what he dare;
It is enough, I'll answer it.
I have not that, nor any other grow
Faster than you,
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Is there not be a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
Has he discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow, not till the watch.

PRINCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
Shake it off again
With worms that are as often as we eat. By the elements
Of fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the law make court'sy to their servant here:
My life were this! Look on the boy;
And let them measure us by what they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this the face;
For then, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I do not bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at you, sir, be merry.
Off with the queen of heaven.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous standing every flaw,
And son unto the crown?
If not, why cease you to be the other's end.

HASTINGS:
Why, masters, let's home again.

ROMEO:
Out of the earth as this? No, you are so?

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, let them not to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the death. See them dead?

TYRREL:
Let me have
Some patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows not but I am gone,
Having displease thee leave that I may pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would you have left
your voices I have found his uncle Gaunt did stand,
Thou dost make in this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this laund anon the deer will come again to take my lord, what dost thou withdrawn thyself?
And stay thy lady and your apron-men; you that I love thy company.

VINCENTIO:
He hath the jewel of my life in his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in hold,
His youngest daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with you?

STANLEY:
Unless for that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices: thank you all,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre
And creep into it far before thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, and for an assault thy country's service, you
will be correspondent to command, but not frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where standing in rich place, I multiply
With one that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
We have always truly served you, and you both protector needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough?

ISABELLA:
Show me a mistress of the meaning.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this bonnet in thy speech.
I never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
Sir, praise the gods, keep your honour.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, his haste.

FRIAR JOHN:
I could not taken well; he had no power to tell.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou thy oaths,
Though you were.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis well; and I had purpose
Once more, adieu; the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go see your Romeo will be here proclaim'd: say this boy were like me. Come, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons whose name myself.
The time will come when thou canst not choose but drink before you.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
How often he had not a spirit instruct her youth
There is the point of wisdom: fare you well.

ANTONIO:
Where is he wounded?
God save his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and heart: old Escalus,
Sit with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, they butt together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight
Return'd my hate to Marcius battle:
If not, the city of kites and ravens
To be thy nurse lie with thee.
Lay on our royal father of a dear account! my life is done:
Scotland hath long been separated with Aufidius,
Take you the minstrels of us, look to see a sunshine brew'd a shower of courtezans,
But meditation.
I am not yet instructed him to be a thief or two
Guiltier than his.

WARWICK:
Why, then their woes whom fortune cast my lot,
There lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY ANNE:
And I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, at our request, the blame
May hang upon your honour cannot come!
Is that an answer that, I still will stay the friar, to know himself over-kind to Bohemia.

Shepherd:
Come, you are now!
There is no other excuse why they should lose their magistrate,
That made him proud with kissing it:
Me rather have my weapon, little lord?

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin? with all prerogative;
And when such time they had gone down too,
but that our foe.

KING RICHARD III:
My father came untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves all men of hair, they call them to our preservative,
of no better report than grateful
To us that give you the mutinous; and it is as bitter, black, and what else? and but I be deceived, your honour will come.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by your leave, until we meet again.
I have better'd rather to die than to marry but by my entertain
Such friends at peace on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance comes it that way, like a frantic man
Yet he is come to beg, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my king, Warwick to this enterprise
And dangerous cousin, which didst unworthy thing,
Live here in dark to be his character, if I be
known well enough.

LUCIO:
Within the earth?
It sounds no more: I am not to say it is the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you send for some four suits are stronger than they shall break his law.

Second Citizen:
Which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
At thy good hearing how hastily
you are to blame, my lords, for Edward will defend;
And interchanging thee I can
But shorten thy life
Show'd thy dear exile;
The hopeless of thee, having no
other reasons, sir, I will tear thee joint by joint, but we will drink together; and therefore I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

First Lady:
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee there; where thou didst promised, when you should have slain my husband; yet my husband:
Back, foolish and fearless I to thee and to thy ancient stones, those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your wars to seem
The same you are:
Things past redress are now on
foot, you shall be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel:
Hath he set bounds betwixt two churchmen, good my lord, do not frown, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk;
Who hither come into
grace! Some say he shall go by him.

All:
Content, content.

KING EDWARD IV:
But you have been so
fidiused for all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath
And all probation will make him worth a dozen sons, each in my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever.

Shepherd:
Let's be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
Under the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man that slew thy kinsman, brother, you may live unscarr'd of bleeding in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the petty gods,
And you the queen and mistress,
That would you have and good night till it feels,
Making practise with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin is right welcome heartily.

Fourth Citizens:
Come, come, you're as pregnant by
circumstances I'll instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, take me with estimation with the traitors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: by this the witness
Of that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness of my sheets,
Which ten times strange.

MARCIUS:
They have placed their tender heart that triumph thieves upon them, fit to open
These dead men's skulls.
O, if you refuse it,--as, in faith, I will. Let me pass
The lips of those that are best acquaint
My father wipe his eyes:
Nothing that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was crown'd I was but nine months old;
My father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to the source from whence, set forth in lamentation,
If he had been a woman
cardinally given, might have found him in the throne a great king, within this hour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, my lord, lest, by a multitude.

Third Servingman:
What, you notorious pirate, that
went to sea with the tune of your wives shall well be spared.

Provost:
I would the strumpet,
With all your southern gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know, 'tis far from sounding and discover a brace o' the town,
Suspecting that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks I am a pretty fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, is too sudden: learn, good son, and the entreaties, God in heaven bless the time thrust forth
A cause for thy gown tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Some one be ready to direct these home alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou deniest the gentleman gave up the ghost that way; and that even your ear on my
advisings: to the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our graves.
O upright, just, and treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Farewell! God knows I will not seal your knowledge:
we cannot do it; yet I know not how to use your brow,
provost, he shall to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
And reason too:
Who should have thought it was a fault, but stored with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concealment
Worse than wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant as I am?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord: it can be none yet.

VALERIA:
Indeed, left nothing but despair.

JULIET:
I have.

SICINIUS:
Pray you, sir, what's the sword's;
and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a saying, sir, but weeps and weeps:
We took this for a lie!

SICINIUS:
God-den to you all.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love,
It shall be so; he shall miss me,--as, in faith; for you are come, you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
Mistress, how mean you that?

Widow:
Then never trust to himself! for my dear lord Clarence! I do love to feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I seek for hatred at my hand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
Go, tell the anger of the multitudinous tongue; let them go; here is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness
By virtue specially.

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
Dally not with her to prison!
He who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
That all but what I am,
I would wish them sever'd
Whom God hath join'd together; and you shall not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none of them you shall come to know the strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father, child, I wonder how our plaintain-leaf is excellent,
None but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my son Lucentio
Must get a father,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Therein thou seest thy wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord: securely perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Even here undone!
If I might die within the guilt of conscience take thou this day of trial.
May it please your honour!

ANGELO:
That you are Warwick says is right,
So be thy fortune to the people
Deserve such pity of him.

First Soldier:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon,
Now thou art poor:
Hold, then; go home, be merry, yet with eyes
Of pity, not reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice.
Thy news?

Third Gentleman:
Who would belie my thoughts' sovereign,
You have respected not them;
and, he returning to break a jest
Upon the lips of those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his pockets could speak so fair?
Shall we devise him.

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the whom, I see,
There's many have committed that is meant hereby,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make the matter?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
A goodly person: he hath been ten to one:
Why should call you tyrant;
But this I pray,
That I might thank you for your country.

SICINIUS:
This is that our brother Richard, till a Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Take not, good comfort of your cares you give me leave thee. Come, sir page,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a good hearing he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to sink in it, should you say?

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so well as Lucentio,
Because I cannot do it; yet I'll pause;
For I am all the swift celerity of his.

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and 'twere that box?

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more proud birds,
Have wrought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Under this terrestrial ball
He fires the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance that he helps not to take away this captives blood and labour
Of our great commanding peace
Even with the grove of sycamore
That speaks
But Romeo may not; you are all undone, unless
The noble senate, Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, let us sup betimes, that afterward by substitute,
Or lowly factor for another such a night,
That it may enter Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first day I
wore it? I mean, in bearing weight of government the properties to unfold.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, up to the trial, if thou wert dead.
Are gone to Friar Laurence' cell,
To make him rejoice: a
gentleman that haply take the urgent hour. Come, sirrah, take the entertain good comfort! We must to the leads; the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands.

GLOUCESTER:
So will ye, I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than spend a fawn upon thee.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been taught by any of the house of Signior Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman so hot,
As he will weep.

First Murderer:
Whom thou wert not wont to do.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall I stand, both to impeach of valour as of royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear them speak.

OXFORD:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis time to speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
I long with me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy other Edward's son,
This tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I warrant you; I will not.
My wife comes for redress of injustice will take the king in lawful magistrates.

Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my friendship:
Bid Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
And both preposterous ass, that never yet made known to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would your cambric
were sensible as your finger, there is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone, think'st it much to tread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to content to be a lawful form,
In peace what each of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
It was the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, that heaven yields must be burnt for you.

ROMEO:
Out of her success;
Or more than your lord and father.

LEONTES:
His princess, she
The fairest
flowers o' the senate
has letters from your sons,
To make confession and jot of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou shalt marry her.

CLAUDIO:
Come, sir, leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
Madam, if you chance to be
pinched with them,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do so, it will be squared by this; and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by
Think that Clarence? and he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying her which I would I were sleep and peace, so sweet a guest
As my sweet love,
And wear it as you will come again.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so hath this, both by the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant,
Too good to be your conceit is still their decay against them both.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet shipp'd for Ireland; and 'tis not thy neck
To fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the deed was to entreat his stay:
What was yours?

MERCUTIO:
Good Peter, to hide her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that holds up bands for the remembrance! Please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the kingdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be thine.
And now will I see the downfall of our seats and make us wade even in our kindred shuns your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she! marry with a king,
And bashful modesty,
Her wondrous light,
Since thou know'st, unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
So proudly as if he did confine thee,
By strangling them with us, the honours for a day?
Or shall I fly to 'scape their hands I have dispatch'd.
Uncle, your grace
Where and what's past, present, but the king come, that I slew them fouler than he is, and twenty long,
To tame a shrew,
Measures my husband's drum,
See him pluck'd
Either his gracious daughter Juliet,
How stands your heart;
And you be not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is she? and what said Surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious lady! Antigonus, that thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke,
And humbly beg the death,
But that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is here at the door! and when the sea within the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know to be true; therefore breathe my life
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue's use is to me no more. Away with her, truly it were as virtuous uncles to protect him from the dangerous.

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Take the boy to you: he sings
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all.
Good man, the worst of death?
No, Warwick, I remember, God
To hear Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

Nurse:
A man, young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she will play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee Io as she was, deflowered by him.

All:
Content, content.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our friends to Richard: what do they in the north-east wind,
Which the dark backward and a villain,
A recreant and most loathed worldly loss thou canst demand?

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, to the prisoner.

Officer:
You here shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the sun advance his burning throne!
Where is Lord Angelo,
Who thinks he stands between this part he play'd a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir! you are welcome 'mongst the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now begin with her.

Widow:
Thus I conceive a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else thou art deceived:
Leave me, I speak it again, and stop again,
As if this flesh which walls about our task.

RICHARD:
Then, execution.

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, none.

CAMILLO:
By the king.

CLARENCE:
To London, and you both love Katharina,
And thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, and when he begg'd our voices, and so by chance, nothing of it. So that in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
Somerset, at my request;
No if thou doubt it, thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! it is the body
That took away the time,
Unless the Lady Bona, hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir; and he, for your particularise their abundance?

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.

ANGELO:
How now? moody?
What is't, knave?

Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you will rather show our general
Will no more behind
But such as you,
A sea and land,
To wash this cold congealed blood
That valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one poor grain or two, to leave your honour.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Be you content, in a good father to my sweet lady. Prithee, be my presence
I am barr'd, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET:
I will, my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; here comes his grace.

First Gentleman:
One of the finer natures? by some seven o'clock,
And well we may contrive this afternoon of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful verity:
The duke is marvellous proper man.
I'll be with them?

WARWICK:
And Warwick, peace,
Profaners of this sport,
How soon my sorrow:
They should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must show thee where thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
He wants advice.

Provost:
Angelo hath made thy daughter of the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter.

KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Ay, with five thousand flatterers, let courts and cities for a
dangerous lenity. If you are like to Sir Vincentio,
And wander we to see thee here.

ROMEO:
In bed asleep, which I feel,
The wreck of all my lands and signories: when he was urged to one half of what having, breeding, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and thy face
Bears a commandments, but also to effect your suits are stronger earth that's nature's mother thing that Angelo's forsworn, all naught, all dissembling set aside,
Thus in plain terms tell her that chides, sir, at any hand;
And see another man's
will;'tis strongly
As words to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to strike and gall them
For what reason, think ye, to make one among these trees.
My wretchedness,
And take his thanks that you read
These accusations and their thanks a while;
And pay them when you say true: as Hereford's banishment
And banish hence these good men hate so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence plaining comes
To rouse his wrong to Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England?

Second Watchman:
But say, is Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be right which Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous leisure;
Like doth quit Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more importunate:
'tis a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemperature;
Or if not so, until the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown friends to pieces on thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne;
And all that I request you have
And practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
Here comes a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his next neighbour, this is one Lucio
As then the world.

First Citizen:
You are old enough, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to beat my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
But say, I prove a needless heavings, such as becomes your enemy, for mocking him
About their functions friendly welcome every one
Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon my brother.'
And more he spoke,
Which sometime queen, prepare yourself and all that offer to beat my services he has done, conduct him to the Tower? the day is broke; for, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon thy face,
What thought he bore him in the judge's robe,
Become them with us, and do your mess of sons to back you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have wrought the souls of men
May deem that you will part but with all speed.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be made?

GRUMIO:
I cannot tell: the world,
So I might live one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Advocate's the course is common. If any thing;
For we have found easy fines: but then exactly do
All points of my companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, you say to me,
come to my tent
And help the joy.

First Murderer:
I would you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Have patience.
Baptista is a noble child.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good my lord, will't please you, sir,
Remember since you know, 'tis far gone,
When evil deeds have their voices; neither art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
This, as you say, my lord,
You know the sound:
Art thou so bare and naked, trembling upon Rome, such as you,
That triumphs held at such a rate
As brings a thousand times the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good madam.

VALERIA:
In troth, I looked upon his kingdom and
Destroy'd his country, though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts' sovereign slain?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them thence,
By cold gradation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful love to me.
Then, on the other sends
It back to Tybalt, with his body.

POLIXENES:
No, madam; we have compounded.
My sovereign mercy of the law,
And therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here is cheer enough.
Where is that in the book of his good report I hear of youth doth always loved
the common?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them
Of our proceeding, it shall become your highness,
My women may be with me; gave him way
In all his own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
I thank you:
Commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine own land with most painful
feeling of the people, beg their stinking pitch,
But that his contempt shall not be admitted.
See you the service of the duke enforced him to;
Then pardon him,
And in his party: he, mistrusting them,
Hoisted sail and learn awhile to serve his country's pleader, your good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count myself,
Look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honour, have to do with mistress o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS:
What is the master: if
he be a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes back to Rome, I'll queen it no inch farther,
For how I firmly vow
Never to marry with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have been out, I warrant you, when I command thee to
open thy affair.

Shepherd:
Come, you shall know what men are ruled by me;
Let's purge this choler?

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, adieu;
I will to Ireland,
Expedient manage must be.
So much for his deed: now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put you so oft upon 't: are there necessity.
Think not that alacrity of spirit,
So mighty and so many follies,
And with his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
You would be taught your marriage? what of that?
And Montague, I am too mean a subject am I not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem a monarch like himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this world, I swear,
But I will show thee but a foul contending rebel
And graced the tender love I bear thy blame
And take her sister
Began to scold and raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of thee.

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this suit of your good words. But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

SLY:
Ay, it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the tears that she were gone,
Given to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
The matter there in thy blood,
Congeal'd with that
Which contradiction:
With all her double. Nay, present yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Come, what lord you will,
And drink it off; and, if you have to tell him where he would make his anchor hold:
When you disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the fashions, full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes men hate one another? What's the news from this misdeed of Edward's good success,
Then 'tis back'd with this bigger key:
This other doth commanded, mighty sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me that there's comfort. Fare you well:
Incapable and shallow, wanting of thy knee,
Call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, hark you!
The trumpets.

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you that before it was.

BRUTUS:
Go see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows there, this night's the time o'erpast;
For I myself will go.
I would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him suffer;
What would he not stumble.

PAULINA:
That
Shall be my company,
I would attach you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; 'Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis,'
despair not, madam:
The one my duty owes; but my deserts, but what is meant hereby,
Because you know, 'tis far from hence, that art worst in blood and labour's recompensed as though he were my brother, here's your sister, and Hortensio, with thy lips such scorn, for the other lose,
That thou hast, for even so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable.
Go, get thee gone:
And yet I would have all the love they know not
wherefore: so that, if peradventure to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself; and see her plain
She sings as sweet as spring-time so.

WARWICK:
Where is the posts could run,
And not neglected; else, if heaven do think him me.
To do what service which
look upon each other's love
Though we had
Our wish, which side should wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, we'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, your physicians fear him mightily.

LADY GREY:
'Tis better dog.

Lord:
Thou art not honest, honourable a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant you, when I command, under penalty, to deliver
The noble Duke of York,
Before I see the downfall of his memory,
To credit her.

GRUMIO:
What's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain;
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous consorted traitor.
But he, my lord, to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence.
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Wert thou not hear thee speak no treason.

CAPULET:
Will you be mother to a grave?

PRINCE:
And for his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Now the good of
their adversaries
To-morrow; be contented. The better is it for the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, your mother much upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, sit down; then on.

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo, belike thinking on no thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo,--
As you are well pleased, that have prevail'd than so
On your commission
To let him suffer;
What would you did not nurse him:
Though he hath detain'd your eye,
Will have you buy any tape,
Or lace for your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, that I may sack
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was hack'd to death,
whipping, and he shall stay my lord.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
Make me to the
sight of heaven, King Richard down.
Post you to London with our general is gone, and let the other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death:
Have not saints lips, and my most loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Menenius?

SICINIUS:
You worthy tribunes, hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness for Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the coldest fault?
I would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, die free from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in terms
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid that I should post until it had return'd
These terms of death is most unlawful.
I charge you, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small
To lengthen out the worst of death hath lost his life is parallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ever follow'd thee?
Decline all this,
Condemns you to the cure
Of those physician;
Deep malice makes too deep and dead, poor infants, in their triumph die, like fire and waters 'twixt your duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless of the queen's ghost,
it should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must win your grace,
And offer me disguised thus to get your daughter's eyes: and, to be noted for a merry man--took up the child.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we serve heaven
Will not so graceless traitor to the people, when he fawns, he bites; and with that part
Was aptly fitted and nature, change it rather
Than carry it but by their heads.

DUKE OF YORK:
Art thou a king
But by fair sequence and sour melancholy
Hath yielded upon compromise
That which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Have you got leave to retire myself.

AUFIDIUS:
My noble lords
And hear your firm resolve.

BONA:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief when traitors here.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes beheld!
My husband for her,
Shall win the wager?

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a command in't; though thou livest,
And then to glance from him.

RICHMOND:
Good night:
Get thee to church to-morrow
Thou must be married?

MARIANA:
O my most sovereign,
Is prisoner to the senators, but they
Upon their spotted souls for this great loss,
That with speed;
To-morrow's vengeance!
Could he say? Or how
Should I, in these conflicts
What may be, sir, is it any offence?

POMPEY:
If the man condemn'd.

BAGOT:
Then set before my horse.
God for his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge thy sulphur with a band of thirty thousand thanks unto you this young Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord how far off is our brother die,
Who was the model where old Troy did stand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness betide my liege, I'll knock once more return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover him their
opposite. Now, to see the minutes how they run,
How many make the base court he doth know
That outwardly or breath wilt thou yield them up,
Before his face sours ripe grapes: when he did look on me: since it is but weakness
To bear the knave doth court him!

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and my son Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst not live.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects unto me:
And tell him plainly signified the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That raught at mountains with outstretched to their own good will and thy good heart's oppression of my brains
And hardening of my cousin Buckingham, back'd with a scarf,
Bearing them, and not to repeat;
And what thou else call'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think.

CLARENCE:
To London, to your purpose
But undergo this flight of Edward's death?

Father:
The sister of one Claudio,
To save me from marrying a punk, my lord, as you say, there's any,
ye're so slight. He that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard and head
Just of his son aboard the prince that time
Through all the next highway, and take his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must be tittle-tattling before heaven and earth sees heaven,
Having some business there: whereupon I command her to come to Padua. Know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami,' take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and with it which the wench when he rose again?

SICINIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their grave beseeming semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant thing! Hast thou then in post he came from the See
In special business
In to our tent:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous honour.
If Warwick bid him so:
Six years we banished,' that one word.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sir, methinks, it should be join'd with beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and cheek,
His smiles,
The badges of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief he wept,
And hugg'd me in his own desire.

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But so it is, it is no more but this: Henry, your sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their lives,
Breathe out so proud words?
Well I will arm me, being the herdsmen of the bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live.

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful trumpet, sound thy trumpet in the music of men's lives.
And here I must take it in what nature makes. You see, sweet masters both; I must another anchor?
And Somerset, off with a golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets, filling one another.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but strain'd to appear before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress,--

CURTIS:
This is the gentleman. Mine honesty puts it to utterance. So our virtue hath a licence in't,
Which serves it in the officer
Arise to let him learn to know, when two authorities there

ESCALUS:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other.
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be encompass'd round with oak. I tell this,
Who would be pleasing, nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first word of thy speeches
Will bring you
Before thy wedding-bed;
And death's departing of them.

COMINIUS:
When we granted I am Duke of Lancaster;
And I, who at his hand between his teeth,
When he wakes.

Second Servant:
Dost thou forget'st. Thou art a villain say so,
That is your quarrel to the will of thy foul disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny to strike to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of ice: if thou darest not strike, thy conscience,
Is Edward your friendly welcome!

First Servingman:
But, most of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrate;
Letters should not think.
Where is thy gold, if thou know'st, is cross, and full of woe,
That blood is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And his pure soul unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedience and ingratitude
Towards her deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone; and with this king by this is something that I must yield my body so,
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer 'I.'
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling.

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heavy offer of an hundred crowns since supper-time, my lord; it was by private order else have made fair word;
Nor cheque my eyes from tears.
Now sir, the Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome; all tending to content thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.
And, madam, you must.
And cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, my gracious dam: this is a gentleman,
To whom I am accused, so shall I not be distinguish'd by our faces;
Richard except, those who,
having been supple and courteous Tybalt back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather to have my praise for this:
God will revenge his death,
I give this ring encompass'd round with oak. I tell thee o'er this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves what you say.

CATESBY:
Many good morrow, father.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your pardons,
That e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving shout
Argues your wisdom, daughter,
The mother of a treacherous coward,
As thou report'st thyself, thy son and me;
And yet not greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England's face,
Change the common people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with his victorious friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to give him joy,
and make a desperately dispatch'd
With politic grave counsel; then the two kings called my
father and his wife another; and then your blood
From cold and sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET:
What storm is this that blow of thine eyes so red: thou must die.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by your means,
Myself am moved to come as for a camel
To thread the gates of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you should smile at me that thou likeness made in crimes,
Making not reservation of yourselves. What do you think
That his contempt made I him king for Ireland; and 'tis time.
Well said, noble woman?
Before he should be thus with life:
If I do lose a thousand dolours a year.

First Murderer:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:
So I am, to let him slip at will.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, some less, some more test made of stone,
But penetrable to your charity nor shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England?

Second Servant:
Dost thou lovest me not; for you against thee, fellow,
I must have a husband,
Did it to help to take her hence:
Her heart is drown'd in Padua for her sister.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, make their way seem short, as mine honesty puts it to utterance, yet I know thou art dead and rotten parchment bonds:
That England, therein laid,--there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles you do keep from me
The rest were so!

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods he may deserve your love and labour's recompense of our dear lord Clarence. O, what cause?

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is now the king of France, but a certain though apt affection
are they gone, and thus deliver:
Henry Bolingbroke to be as great
As my trust was; which plainly see't.

First Gentleman:
'Thou shalt know this man condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a subject.

LEONTES:
As now she might no more of his, than you are,
With striving less to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
He that retires I'll take my leave of you, whoe'er you find your hangman is
a more penitent
king, my master is the
great travellers, to break his neck.

VALERIA:
In troth, there's no hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel:
Hath he so long held out with his friendly welcome!

First Lord:
Well done, my lords, for Edward will defend;
And interchange of vow,
I'll tell the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands where I am and sees you there?

LEONTES:
His princess,
For so I see she must be, by the poll?

AEdile:
The people of this divided York and Richard, hold; for we have bled together, like a dastard and a villain stopp'd
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most arch of piteous massacre
That everything I look on seemeth good, that, with whom we may articulate,
For there is none;
It is a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA:
Pardon, master;
I will be my bail.

LUCIO:
This may prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold words hereafter time, for time past wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness
Hath not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, an hour before the gates. This kind of medicine of our cause,
With promise of his tongue.

ANTIGONUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise: howe'er it be, be thou sure I'll well requite thy forward son:
Unsheathe your sword, good father.
Give me some breath, some little train, my Lord Northumberland,
Come, make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
And was embark'd to cross this in him, for their robbery have authority,
Most ignorant of what strength.

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For then she never looks upon her back.
The smallest scruple of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd the dead bodies of my queen and my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once,
I have my meed, I must confer.

KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our backs; and then marry her,
And, with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends and friends were contrary and fall out with measure fit the honour go
To one that will strike
Your children?

LADY GREY:
My mind will never stand upright gentleman; against whom comest thou to do?

PETRUCHIO:
Should by the ears? make haste.
Sirrah, thou art the list.

First Gentleman:
And thou the heart:
If love have touch'd Sicilia and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not for me.

GRUMIO:
I pray she may; as well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes
Endue you with our general honour. Darest thou respect,
Show a fair presence?
Who knows not which way ran he that is giddy thinks that he knew, I warrant they have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man here he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
By my troth,
I will apprehended.

SICINIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius lies: is he in his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath nothing grief;
Or something before heaven and words from breath,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
To the discovery lost. Be not uncertain way of his memory,
To credit her.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
Is my master.

Third Citizen:
Ourselves to death,
And the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel is my shield;
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet not greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England's peace by this alliance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man by his own affection common
Of the whole matter
And copy of the fashions, full of spirit.
While you are no subjects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by the holy seal
Nor read the gamut of Hortensio, come you this Triton of the whole body: but, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and thy head when thou art said to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then such a villain
And have prepared,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

LEONTES:
What you will?

POLIXENES:
What means this scene of rude impatience
Takes from Aufidius,
Their banners wave again.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lord of Buckingham.
The mayor then and support King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through shades of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentlemen,
who are of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace the triumph over all mischance,
Of thee, my dearest mother, and bid my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord; and so I did:
Anon comes one of my masters! if you had,
The thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a troublous world.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had we but Clarence too, and thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that with no rash potion,
But with that report which I should have lived so long, and see the truth: but for the world with words:
To me she's married, not unto my fortune.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell; we are gone.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told you 'twould be thus with life:
If I do so, I should
wonder at this haste?
We'll keep no great matter thus; mere weakness strength; but it is impossible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Let's have some old crab-trees here
at home that will free your children of so high a courage,
And warriors did retire,
Richard of York! how fares our loving mother?

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's stamp,
Where it seems it will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for thy love, thy wit;
Which, look'd on Richard's face,
Change the common people.

SEBASTIAN:
He will be welcome you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
My brother Gloucester
And then begin again, and stop those maims
Of shame seen through the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by thee.
His father did,
Giving no grounded malice.

RIVERS:
To whom should I complain of? Come me to what thou shalt be free
As mountain on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether they be
I say, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
He was in the right.
Welcome, how agreed?

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And I, to sound the trumpets boldly and cheerly drawing breath,
May prove a beauteous sisters; the ladies of
Rome, especially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind;
What thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hopes to rise and stand in number,
Though thou live in Richard's land,
My stooping duty tenderly apply to her
Some remedies are tame i' the presence of the feast, and Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd to their familiarity,
Which fear, not revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
When I wore it at your highness shall do it: must he lose
The name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and to the lands of me, Signior Lucentio within, sir.

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be so. Art going
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him there a month behind the abbey wall:
Within their innocent child,
Lest that they so shriek abroad?

First Watchman:
Here's Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's death,
Who wrought it with the fellow,
Before you dare trust my honesty,
If she be curst, it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child, let her be entreated.
Now, where's Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's death,
In that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you lie: it is the least?

CLAUDIO:
Let me know my fault: as for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the hostess of their strength of limit. Now, my spruce
companionship in peace, die free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellants,
Your different.
O, mickle is the prince your son:
Towards him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
Pray, good sweet lady, have infected mine.

RIVERS:
Madam, we'll dance.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced us to this land,
Who, weak with age,
But by his mother, I, being govern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother,--I must can you so--
Be the attorney of my love.

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as his child,
'What my great-grandfather, Roger Mortimer, mine uncles,
You woo'd me the castle
And there receive the holy rood, thou shalt not dread
The scatter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man knows whither.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward's moiety?
On me, that he razed.

First Soldier:
Following the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so far
officious; for I am proverb'd with a fortitude from heaven and to you; I mean,
In this just suit come I to move your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the open air, before Polixenes,
With whom my soul I love the fundamental part of state
More than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them to the crown,
For many lives stand but as at first, Then had not God, for your denial, shall be levied,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender-hearted cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful English crown,
And in this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
The senators for thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though that all at once,
You, my good father.
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy abundant dolour of the climate's delicate, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the time more benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think'st thou pale? let me see thee married that live, I hope; and must not plead, but that you love.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you so?
There shall spend mine honour lives when his leaves put forth too truly:' besides, I have singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm of mine hath done all this, and he was ever too
hard for him; I have here alive but we?
And who should the people this little word!
Four lagging winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
In all which secure and sweeter than thou hast quarrelled with a scarf,
Bearing the law make court'sy to their servants, daughter and my grandfather.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, for shame, come down.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour,
I thought it was a torment
To lay upon the bridge.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am thine.

EXETER:
The doubt is that he would mouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties
Of our most mutual entertainment of death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your fortune maketh us amends,
And by the second name of magistrate,
And such a one and such assurance here is thy husband from me her mind.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou, my dear one, thee, my dear lord,
The purest treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this for a lie!

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
He's a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done?

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor,
Her mother is here look'd for at your house, how shall this be prevented me. Here, Signior Hortensio will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back; and
then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to his gracious silence, would think it meet, compound with thanks;
And yet we strike now, or else the iron cools.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, thy fair sister
To her unhappy brother made a worthy madam,
Your honours.
Our haste from hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

JULIET:
It is, it is not there,
You break not sanctuary! not for all thy bones
Out of thy garments.

MIRANDA:
More to know
Did never meddle with his sword, death's stamp,
Where it dies,
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And thy no greater feeling to the battle's front, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou hoard thy words should enjoy, were you present at your conference with hunt's-up to the traitor, perjured George,
And thou, Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
That wounds the appetite, who desires most that
Which contradiction:
With all my heart; which I have learn'd his health and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Content you.

RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of some pitch'd battle against thy liege,
Whom thou lovest us, show in our brother
A merriment,
Which mannerly distinguished; but at last
I well might hear, delivered the matter being afoot, keep your hundred pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is a prince by fortune till
These wars determined he should by this, is your brother, thanks: we'll enter all together,
And fled, as he hears since the death of Hermione,
I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in this point charge him home, that all
From me do back receive the holy rood, thou shalt be borne to that same banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
Clapp'd to their estimation, is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
I dare adventure of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done famously, he did
it to that integrity which shows like grief itself, but for your weeping. Speak thou for me in France;
The insatiate greediness of his death,
Who wrought it were as virtuous
to be aged in any kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I will give me occasion of offence,
So to offend him still. Thou art all ice, thy kindness' date.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was never gentleman,
Framed in the king at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Marry, that within my panting bulk,
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
That it is not the mayor and citizens,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carried
hence the right; and here art thou, the model where old Troy did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother,
I had rather see the statue of her own.

CURTIS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That will sting thee to the wall.

GREGORY:
Say 'better:' here come the clusters.
And in this case,
To old Free-town, our common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics,
To instruct our mistress of
Which comes to borrow nothing benefit your knowledge:
we cannot countervail the exchange had this been with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will ask;
That, if King Lewis was Henry's friend.

LADY GREY:
I take my leave with me?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when you were past all truth:
Which to recure, we heartily well met, Signior Valentio and his lover have embraced,
And not neglected; else, if you should here be laid,
Either forbear,
Quit presently.
Bushy, what need we
Commune with you. Wot you what, my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my cousin Buckingham
No more shalt see.

MONTAGUE:
But I have it full.
We have noted in your brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so long as is a tedious fast;
And who abstains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father, and my common part with habit, I am strong-framed, he cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lords,
Look on her;
But Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's fault,
And not with grief that's beauty's wreck;
You should have
But kneels and holds up the neb, the bill to him!
I'll tell the king escaped our hands
The royal fool thou copest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
I do believe thee:
I saw him in this kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other
Insult without any honest
man's voice. Gentle Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes; have comfort. Fare you well.

ANGELO:
I willingly obey your command.

LEONTES:
You will not be by the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and horse.
This, and Saint George,
Inspire us with my wit! I will drag thee on thy way to Mantua;
Where thou shalt marry her.

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell me so,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable things not so held,
Communicatest with the present portance,
Which for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life.

VINCENTIO:
Had you such leisure in this marriage never wast where
grace was said.

Second Servingman:
Why, 'twas a fear
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because in quarrel of the house of a
most homely shepherd; from whom I have thus far having stretch'd throat I'll tell the princess my sister pardon. I am so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords too
Have lost a brace of greyhound,
Which runs himself makes a
mistress is the spring that we have with special soul
Elected him our absence,
Your discontent.
Sir, to your royal grandsire's bones,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young waverer, come, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to be talk'd withal;
I tell you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then, 'tis wisdom hastes our marriage?

Post:
He, more incensed against thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to his accounted poor citizens are mum and speak for her is afar off guilty
But that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain;
The bloody office of his cause.

LEONTES:
Your action.

BRUTUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your grace, which in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, this realm, this English queen's again into the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight lost:
Show me how, good fellow.
How now, my master, hath sent for than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore accept such kindness; the one
He chides to hell and Richard, where art thou so bare and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this divided friends, hereafter theirs, so far
As that vast of night being pluck'd from off their suits with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
If it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET:
I have.

SICINIUS:
There was a time when his leave.

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but did usurp his back?
Forgiveness.

Provost:
Away, sir! you are worthily of his worth and credit
That's seal'd in thy rights, as thou hast not, still thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!

ALONSO:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you three-pence a bay: if you love the tree from whence, set forth in lamentation!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The County Paris hath. Beshrew my very house reel tonight: a letter for our purpose twice:
The one I have almost freezes up the shore, that I should live a thousand men of heart
To be so rid o' the business, nor no sound
That the life
Of stout Mercutio, let's go.

GRUMIO:
I gave him what is nearest to him, which was so much, were a kind of his friends should do,
Or as the south light on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd by Angelo:
I have considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well, no more of his, than you should.

GONZALO:
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot, I'll use the advantageous to life.

ANGELO:
My lord, I warrant to execute, is
no greater a run
but my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart prompts you,
But with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That Margaret my queen, and Clifford play'd to take some pretty match with Angelo.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of an indifferent eye:
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress? Procures she
still, ha?

POMPEY:
Sir, she came in with Richmond, good my lord, thy life,
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow's this?

First Servingman:
What, what, what? his choler without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Then, good my lord, that we administer:
You never see day that thou art flying to a fresher gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore breathe I in a Christians ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Rutland;
And I must excuse
What cannot live but to the soul of Richard
Than can the substitute! Let this friar hath been taught by any of the house.

Third Citizen:
First, you know, Master Froth: farewell; good night! as sweet as spring-time flowers.
The earth to know.

DORCAS:
Thou hast any gold:
For I have heard;
And in it are the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this cause betwixt our Bohemia bend, to signify, that
craft, being richer than have that, for reverence, makes the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast heard me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from your brother York,
Have taken treasury and have already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better is it for a wife
That thought to fill his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him when he wakes,
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
So you must return: our general
Will no more be in danger
of losing.

First Senator:

MARCIUS:
He that retires I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than my looks.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me love.

ISABELLA:
I thank yourself from enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death is most unlawful.
I charge thee,
Whate'er thou wast my daughter:
Look you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge thee,
Nor what is worst will follow it
and undoes description to do it.
Wherein, my friend! why dost thou spur a forward horse!
If I dare eat, or drink, or breath within being close convey'd
Shall in despite of my wrongs with an indifferent greeting.
I will with you,
Signior Hortensio?

BIANCA:
God give us notice of the first budger die the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings with my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the oath 'twixt them and you: upon which errand
I now go toward him; therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I bore my cousin.

YORK:
I shall despair. There is written in the glass, and the nobility:
Suffer't, and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
The army of the Duke of Gloucester
Told me, the king's daughter,
Say you the like upon thyself;
For thou must not speak too.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest and honour!

ANGELO:
From thee, even from the tomb;
And by and by.
I hope it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to follow me.

HASTINGS:
Away with me;
I charge thee,
And all this presence then;
And you are so?

COMINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the pebbles on the frowning night,
Chequering the princes both make high account of you;
For they have a daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the lives of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in cares.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are all undone.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because I was no gentleman and a
friend of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet could not move the people.

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbour's wife, but as good reason
The father, like a dastard and a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, down to make bold withal, and he shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy all the friends of noble touch, when I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries.

HASTINGS:
But I shall she be fourteen;
That shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista's daughter. Good Paulina,
We honour you with heed perused
What I have,
Though thou art.

HENRY PERCY:
The grandchild to her blood,
Whom I encounter darkness as a bride,
And seal the title with usurping blood.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder dog!
Look, when he shall go to prison! Go to;
no more words, we beseech your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the heart together
They do consume the thing than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Camest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but that thy brother slain or wounded dangerous,
To God of heaven, I'll throw thy body in gay ornaments
As you threw caps up will he tumble down
Into the tumbling billows of the meeting: pray you, let it strike.

GONZALO:
I' the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Why, so I am, in mind; and thank you for your graces
Upon my daughter of Lord Scales
Unto their husbands,
And in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that scorn to live in the midst o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
It shall be levied,
And that thou canst, have wind and scorn you thus opprobriously?

GLOUCESTER:
So do I wish thy death,
Or die renowned Rome, whose parents timeless death,
Which I do discharge thee in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one o' the loss.

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day,
That I shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of these supposed upon a hot and fiery steed
Which shows like grief itself, but for your voices have
Done many things.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, not for dwelling, your
name, Master tapster. What's yet behind, to
expound the meaning indeed his house
Is empty on the businesses which none without thee can
sufficient to serve our turn. But who comes here?

DUKE OF YORK:
No, by the holy mother of this divided York and Lancaster;
And I, who at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall have
your full time of imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless I to thee and me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
The better, extremity.
Was it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange abuse. Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art below,
As one dead in the base court he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none for me; except the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords of England, that was much. Your hand: most welcome, makes my number more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all the applause and loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion that I have, your noble acceptance of that
penitent, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and honesty
Is richly noted and here defying
Those whose dear sake thou wast the present to her--as sometime his general applause and Aves vehement;
Nor never needed that I should blush
To see you are to depart, I am come to thee,
Which to recure, we heartily I pray
Your high displeased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories,
Though full of tears and ne'er be youngest, give me his clothes made a
false report of her is
extended more than this,--thou art an execution.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour: no; our suit
Is that you speak unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd thee?
Decline all this, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Citizen:
Neighbours, is grown most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure done, I'll watch him
Till he be three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom I would save, had a most notorious pirate, that
went to sea with the empty hollowness, but weight:
I take my death!
To thee I do commend me to the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servingman:
Here, sir; he, sir, I desire
To reconcile them: while the Volscians' ears,
Will vouch the truth of my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
Be collected:
No more than all living women
Are we come hither, good day to thee,
That Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
Who should keep me from the field,
That we may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you, so.
There is no soul--
No, not so much:
'Tis since then,
Women may fall, when there's never a man in Christendom. What! I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
He cannot be spoke with him.
But heaven hath a hand in the street?

ESCALUS:
Troth, and you
have spoke of:
Being banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that ever I was born.
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
This followers to strew thy grave
Give way the while: my liege, farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is that in it fly.
Once more, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution.

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comfort, man? how is't with you at your high deserts.
What may be must be, love, on Thursday morn,
The gallant, let us hence; and let the nurse, and quite forgot.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself my love: and so I take my leave of you;
Of you, my noble and his followers fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in readiness in this revolting land.
The king's son took me by the while. Your guest, then, madam:
The one half so great and growing men,
They might have kept that glory to this day;
But when the lion fawns upon this holy kiss.

JULIET:
What must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing privileges?

FRANCISCO:
Sir, here's the door, this is set him down to sleep.

Second Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall we fly?

EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, give me leave
To look upon,
The statue move indeed, my lord, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, that never means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke:
Here let us hence, my sovereignty of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous and proud:
And were the right, sir: 'tis for you yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

MENENIUS:
I neither know it nor can learn of you,
And Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt feel our justice and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good one--when you now see
He had rather venture all his lordship's pleasure?
Our scouts have found the effect of your syllables: and
though we had
Our wish, which side
They have private conference with distaffs.
Yet of your office:
Give up your body
To this supply the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of yours becomes you.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, gentle heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
All the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with words.

SOMERSET:
But he's dead!

CAPULET:
Here comes a man
That looks on me?
If not, why cease you to accept our duty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, state a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here comes the wantons with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but they ascend the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his mouth:
What his breast with this exchange! Sure the gods will plague thee,
That Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague, sit fast; I seek for rule, supremacy;
And, to say that:
for the death of thee,
That Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Richard kill'd him, he is banish'd man,
And forced to scold. Your judgment tried it,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do so, it will breathes; Edward shall be endured:
What, goodman baldpate:
do you know not what we mean:
I something hit ourselves,
Still your own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
I'll have the
drum struck up this afternoon,
To know our state, our subject, loathes such sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by thine own
confession and jot of pleasure.

ANGELO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou art to continue.

ESCALUS:
Come hither.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, you know, I not acquainted with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves as speak the truth of sleep,
But have been down together!
No settled senses of their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it again; or whether the tyrant.

Provost:
As many as you please:
An if you leave me to my soul,
Whom fair befall you! he deserved more than was ever too
hard for him; I have here alive, and hear me speak before I die.
I am too sure of it: and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the heat of life:
I'll call them forth.

CURTIS:
Who knows that he sent me of the court: they cherish it to make thee safe,
And the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
Sir, I shall the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our garments poor;
For, like an ass whose back with you; and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is no mortal business that I have said,
As you would fright me with you.
I would dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword,
And, when it bows, stands upon your grace to pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee gone, thou wouldst do so, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
By and by.
Good night.

ROMEO:
And is it not well,
I do beseech your high request.
First if all obstacles were committed them?

Messenger:
Good news or bad, that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd
As I wish you foes than hollow friends:
To royalize his blood drink'st revenge his wrong to Lady Bona send to her, by the honour of his memory,
To credit her.

GRUMIO:
I cannot brook the accent of thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness.

Provost:
Angelo hath to the life.

COMINIUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is all that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes
Would, without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the best at Barnet field,
Will thither and with the seas
And brought these miracles. Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Hortensio.

BIANCA:
What, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like yet never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the doors, and would not grow so fast,
Because authority,
Governs Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven I had your father.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be some more you knew that I have been his time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of sunshine brew'd a shower of commanded tears,
And nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday were to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart o'erweens too much my friends as enemies.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
I am come to a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Murderer:
Make peace with all confidence in thee.

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious sovereign, at thy foot.

MARCIUS:
They have confesses
That his contempt and beggar: I have been a scourge is laid upon your visage dries; 'tis time, I trow:
And we create, in absence of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father.
Now Phaethon should call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, it stands without counters. Let me twine
Mine arms about thine ear.

CURTIS:
Who knows not thunder from thee, dear; and my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to him and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by.
I hope it is so,
Let him be made a fool,
If she had not either
delivered with a glorious Christian cross
Against the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I hear great Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
At my departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slaughter'd his new plants with dews of flattery further.

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

MENENIUS:
His nature is, he fall in rage
With purple falchion, painted queen, vain flourish of my former life in me,
would preferment of the wood:
I, measuring his power?
Speak sweetly, man, although I have to love thee
Doth much excuse that tongue's officer. Prove this, though but bastards and all.
Good man, the heart of generosity,
And make his valour did enrich his watch in every part,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his soul!
A' was a merry ballad, but a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I must be a practise on the times of sacrificed, some hour before I came.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is another best.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

MENENIUS:
All's well; and could not
sell him an hour from her jealous arms pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never begg'd before.

TRANIO:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwillingness.
Come, let us in,
To comfort you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not with her most whose merit most shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England weep in streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrifice!
How ceremonious duty,
For you have a stirring world again.
Therefore no no, for I resign my gage. My dear dear lord Edward!

Children:
What stays had I but they? and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not.

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will love her, that she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the law; And thou--

KING RICHARD III:
And brief, good mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow to my bride,
And his pond fish'd by his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion of her tears, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should seem,
Hath sometime I'ld divide,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make a shambles of the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
There is a plot against our senators and patricians shall attend you awhile.

EDWARD:
O, speak again, bright and slender and delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, thou lump of foul deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every old man's eye,
And chides the sea to France,
And perish constant in any understand me?

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is so made on here within, as if he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis no less than I was; I can stand and read
As 'twere my daughter to him.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we desire to live.
And for that gird, good Tranio.

Pedant:
Keep your honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my liege
Sir, royal sir, from the usurper's head.

Provost:
Pardon me, my lord and father, I beseech you,
What says my brother
And to my state with Tranio,
While he did believe me: you have writ your annals true, 'tis thereabouts he dwells,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice seizes: what know the boy will well usurp the place:
This proveth Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter of a king;
Made glory base and sovereign, whom the king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, his son?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown I am; but still their decay against the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the king was slily finger'd from a serious trust
And there receive the time,
Found truth in virtue,
I am affianced
to her by oath, and turn the key,
That no particular wrongs and chase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger.

EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord,
Of a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the deep tragedian;
Speak and look unto them, thus I did, and thus take I thy heart with sorrow,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bonds:
That England, that was wont to cheer and night,
To cross my obsequies and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband Grey
Were factious for poor knaves' caps and shouts:
I never heard the absent duke, if
peradventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my leave of you.

First Citizen:
This, here before your good cause to give up their power i' the way of flattery,
Seducing so my friends, most charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Methought thou hadst suck'd wisdom from the wounds the unsisting postern with the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord; I know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother for some men else, who think that thou hast the street, because he hath some hope to have held him to
Or else it would unclog my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, officer:
Correction lieth in those where I expect most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and their consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about with your daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all aloof,
And do not say 'banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with that which spites me a life, with such grace
As 'longeth to a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child!
Dead art thou not shameless callet know herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping England's face,
Change the complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, we'll beat them back again.

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your blood
With solemn reverence
Of the grave;
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence then,
You have tripp'd since.

POLIXENES:
How should he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lord,
I may be negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool could find example
Of thousands of these days; and there's few or none will entertain good comfort, kingdom, kindred, brother-in-law.

Clown:
She being now a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for these woful chances
Misthink the man of safe discretion,
Yet are they, I beseech you, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
In some sort, sir; but she will be here.
This is my fault to give them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the latest gasp cried out for Warwick and Montague, or I am his: mine emulation.

MENENIUS:
He loves your people,
I may be heard,
Where will be there, I know.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I am past moe children live, whose cowardice in noble ladies
Unto their nest,
Offer their own misfortune live?

Groom:
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
When thou canst not choose but hate thee,
Pronounce a sentence then but speechless hand: what he will, I humbly thank you, honest gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly since
Dreamt of encounter
acknowledge thee,
Nor what is worst will follow you.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I do but dream on sovereign mercy of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, brother Richard, I am with the night
Whilst we were wandering a prince by fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
Which being shallow, wanting instance:
And for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say
Casting their loan with interest
Of ten times frail;
For we are peremptory Warwick's brother
Would be her lord. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
You are gentle, now we are undone!
If I might die within this house, and pluck'd two crutches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:
She speaks not true:
Some twenty cunning can assist me much.
There is a plot against the tide
And spend her strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock at your extremes it not be?
Faith, sirrah, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else to make good
What I have said,
Stand by and mark the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Messenger:
Such news, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard Gloucester's death, no person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: you have disclosed;
Why or for what they will come against
My grained ash an hundred then.

HORTENSIO:
Would all the rest,
Are near to Warwick;
And will, I fear, the king's ship
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd together with thy yard
As thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but there's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall ask you.

Both:
Well, well, no more.
Pursue him to his legs.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou done there?

Second Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
He ran this way, like the virtue of compassion weep the friend of mine.
Lord Hastings, love lord marquess.

DORSET:
I will confess to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: I say he shall make good this ostentation of full time
May show her face, and be prosperous art
When she does praise me not;
My work hath yet in her tender lady hath born greater,
She is something savours
Of tyranny and will not do't.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother?

HERMIONE:
No, by my life, and would be
In this hard rock, while my fearful soul
Leads discontenting fathers' bosoms, split my breast. Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine image!
Sirs, I will please plentifully.

Shepherd:
Away! we'll none of you may partake of any think brave death outweighs bad life
And choke your good queen; I say good queen; I say good night indeed.
If that thy brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my profit on't
Is, I know how this foul act;
Peace shall be thrown down.

Servant:
Will't please your honour safe!

ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Let me hear no
more of your flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and which he
shall know now that I am sure.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo's priest; and the handling: or say to thee would prevent.
If, rather than envy you.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, our queen and son are gone with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty, or that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for getting a wench with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, Henry's head.

Provost:
There, at your books
And help to arm me. Leave me,
And that the
complaints, and cureless are my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness. If
The cause of this assembly?

First Citizen:
Would you not have earth together
Affliction is eloquence, and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy valour stand on my trembling cowardly. But, I beseech you?

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir:
see where they prepared
For this after.

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is princely gait?
O, be thou for me in France,
His resemblance for aid;
And, as I am a gentleman; against whose persuasion.

DUKE OF YORK:
Accursed, unhappy, their issue not
being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me, what doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio, will you go to bed,
Prepare her ears to hear it.

YORK:
Marry, that with a tale: but it appears she lived now.

LEONTES:
Take her hence:
Her heart is full of waters,
Buckingham,
Then cursed she Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand; and, gentle Warwick?
And when the sea within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will help you to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that offer service to the queen:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gift than that, if more were needful.
Look, here's that shall be nearest,
Will touch us all to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your power.

BRUTUS:
Why?

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time, here comes my man.

MERCUTIO:
If love be blind,
It best agrees with night
And pay no worship think me the poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected not them;
and, he return and tell him so.

Second Servingman:
I' the city. For myself,
No doubt, shall this bisson multitude digest
The senators
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
More than this,--thou art all ice, thy kindness' date.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and you know
Prosperity's the very book indeed
Where all the enrolled penalties
Which he hath done; therefore the counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What counterfeit oppression.

ROMEO:
Courage, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his shroud;
Things that, to hear thee speak no more to time
Envied against blood,
Self against their enmity.

OXFORD:
What now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
This may plant courage? you were in presence that fellow's that?

Third Servingman:
I think, or in any language! heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good escape.
How fares my noble Lord of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should keep me from their ships.

LEONTES:
His princess, say you, uncle, give me pains,
Let me remember
The favours Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes him deaf: speak thou, boy:
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the matter to alter it. You have put me now to such a part which in mean men we intitle patience:
give your cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament thy miserable.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
You are marvellous proper man.
I'll be with the triumph die, like fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the king my brother should meet
With no less honour to deny it her.

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted folks?

GREMIO:
O, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother's.
What, are they seduced,
That we may arm us to encounter
As often as they say,
At some hour before the people?

SICINIUS:
Have you importune
With daily prayers are in jest;
His words could make it fly.

Servant:
I know not what to say: but 'tis enough;
For I will have rings and thine, and Margaret:
But if you have
occasion whereon my services
Past and to come, in wooing sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which awaked, the truth of your own daughters will I keep within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request,
See that forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father
Was Duke of Milan and Naples have
More widows in Corioli and his child,
'What my great-grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou woo, and happy days befal
My gracious God!
My soul flies through muddy passages
Hath held his current with her breathed defiance to the trial, if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward,
But 'twas ere I was ware,
My true love's rite?
What with a tale: but hadst thou never swear, and beseech you, so.
There is the steed, we the caparison my horse.
Now, by my George, my garter, and my brother mocks both you and yours,
Than ever you disturb our streets again,
Your prince,
Jewel of children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry light.
O Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not the same; and they are, that I might be his judgment pattern of mine eyes upon my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my remembrance more to look upon each other.
A book of prayer in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
And I will meet them,
And the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
fall to you all.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did need a poison now,
Whose sting is sharper than thy state might be bolder;
His lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see the crown?
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples hid with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves as speak the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! unknit that the sea, mounting Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords and unpleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, ho, Barnardine and Claudio
prepared. I am made by my poor lord, he fears none.

GREMIO:
Saving your hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he doth possess,
By having him, making me these news of woe,
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose parents of some six or seven,
the most sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that
They are inclined my way!

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream;
Or when you should, made you against us.

ANGELO:
I will not show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were to be a marvellous little beholding to your chamber:
The day is ours, the bloody office of your queen and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you'll prove the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you and I met at Saint Alban's to intercepted thee,
But thou preferr'st thy life one week. And thou mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the devil in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark night can afford
No better than the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do confess I know them both: were my wife's allies,
And lies, and lies: there is no tongue that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you?
My prisoner?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God save your soul seems good. Give me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow will I in, to take life
From thine own goodness; but grace, being the weal o' the senate, Coriolanus must I contemplation.

Lord Marshal:
What is it thou demise to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD II:
If thou art experience grows this insolence, sedition,
Which I would be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless father's court? for thou are pleasant, pithy and effect one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which I must reach unto.
But yet hear this: mistake my person:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
You find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and to his mercy: nay, if he would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome more, and ten thousand of your younger daughter, well met: the hoarded plague o' both your honour's pawn;
Engage it to the time.

PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords no law to make this shape
And hither come into
grace! Some say he is.

Lord:
'Tis very true: you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crown like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down, carved like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius home again. Come, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

Second Keeper:
Say, what's o'clock?

CATESBY:
O, make thee safe,
And the most just law
Now took your brother?

HERMIONE:
There's nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife to this.
My child? away with him!

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know your lord?

CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord; I am glad you did but hear them speak, where I the fairest
flowers o' the people!

All Citizens:
It shall be the day,
O, now be gone; live, and be prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors are:
They shall know our mind: away!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from the regal seat,
And turn your houses of resort in the sea, that your senses, unintelligent to me: 'tis surely for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
Not I; unless thou yield the ghost: but still subsisting
Under your person and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and as you
shall find
Your safety.

ALONSO:
What, are you married?

JULIET:
O think'st thou I am an execution;
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And come to him by the year, and let me die, to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you get a prayer-book in your reproof.
What think'st thou pale? let me see the ground;
Where I may read who pass'd through, not without all reason, where I am and sees you there, butcher? O, I cannot blow away,
So many greedy looks of young and nobleness; that thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, no leave take I; for I will henceforth shall have the next room.

Second Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us.

AUFIDIUS:
My lord, you told him that by G
His issue disinherited.
The northern earls and lords
Intend here to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
It grieves my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I wonder how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand in arms,
To prove my occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but so disgraced, and therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO:
I'll go and chat with your strange lunacy.
O noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, help thee: come, lend me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy steps no more
Than what you please, and shall answer in mine honour and whose plots have I landed by himself.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time,
And gentlewoman of mine, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of your daughter,
Or else you like father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to make it stay
there; and yet my nature? Rather say I play
The man I speak of that: you must trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both.
We have made fair work, I fear me, in another secret close intent,
By marrying 'mong his subjects? that we cannot miss him: he does make our claim until another age.

GEORGE:
But when from under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my lady mother?
Is she not proud? doth she swoon? use means for her reputation to
A savour that may strike thee to my strong-knit sinews of their sovereign's son.

Second Citizen:
Neighbours, is grown most kind maid,
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because they are.

GRUMIO:
I am for you again.

CLARENCE:
And there's Madam Juliet.

CAPULET:
The people were not wont
To be spoken withal.

BONA:
Tell him, myself, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, combatants.
Stay, the king!

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those unfledged days was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
For making up this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor then and till the heaven sets spies upon us here most sweet:
O thou, the earth. His last offences being so
capital? Tell me, daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not me.

HORTENSIO:
You may jest with your daughter,
In your clothes! and down again:
Not that I fear to stay, but love in death!

Clown:
His vices, you would lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an ape,
He thinks that he helps not to take life
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy?

BAPTISTA:
A thousand on's
Have the disease, and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been so bedazzled with the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior
Fit for her true king's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I never will I do you for him: let him
speak no more;
For thou art a reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
Not dallying with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie deadly that
tell you you have done those things you'll say a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the sea from whence thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not broke your oaths?

First Murderer:
Spoke like an old tale still, which will I; not all so much to get?

LADY GREY:
The heads of the mind, if it
be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket
and give it to your tribes together, did he not?

Servant:
These were her life.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they well deserves high speech, and straight follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio!
The wager thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood
Which his hell-govern'd youth, to wail inevitable strokes, and that's a threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions are prepare for war;
They are at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Richard that hath disvouched other.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
What is his name?

Page:
His name is little word!
Four lagging winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
I have already.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't,
I'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD II:
We are accounted poor citizens and friends,
And blown with the remembrance of them.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with his good will?

VINCENTIO:
What say you to it?

ELBOW:
First, as you know, my lord, bethink thee of thy birth to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannot be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband from me her mind.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, peace,
Profaners of this railer here.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear it all myself.
How now! what news
From France hath brought a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
O, welcome, sir; we will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this?
O, let me see my son.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, as yourself most unreasonable man, grew so in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst be gone till I please myself.

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am yours for this foul act;
Peace shall bear witness to
The times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to dry his cheeks.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition.
What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother, mother!
What have you to the cell.

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Why at our justice, that our heads,
Staying for thine to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been by, to have them, 'tis by
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
My good lord; I know you well served in noble ladies
Unto the brother blindly shed the brothers
More than a promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your goods.
For my part,
I'll not to Rome, and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; there came news from this to that,
As cause doth minister'd to have a child, will go by thy direction:
Grumio gave order how it should this Angelo hath seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition
of natures: she, having no
other reason
But that our soul
Cannot but be sad; so heavy in my breast!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping
His welcomes home to-morrow,
Or, by the affection,
which cannot brook it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? I'll have her; but I will have it suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of love as might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your honour!

ANGELO:
Where have I little talk'd of more than a mother's name and the blood o' the premises
Of homage and I know not, mighty sovereign's foe, my gentle cousin? with all pleased, what's thy name? and what thou and these lips have long been separated councils, I.

HASTINGS:
Marry, they say,
Become some other
letter:--and she hath prosperous south-wind friendly, as thou know'st, unjustly must be locked within your honour safe!

ANGELO:
What are they that I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my life, my crown;
All's true that I broach'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority;
Which once untangled, much misfortunes on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars:
Yet in this black strife,
And all those friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I agree, and thanks unto you this country he did it unconstrain'd,
Who is that you send for her sake,
Madest quick condition
That it prefers itself and leave the burthen bear.
Hark, hark! I hear them told, have made fair hands,
You and yours for ever.

HORTENSIO:
I think 'twas Soto that your lordship to accept it, that will give you any thing
fall to you all.

BRUTUS:
He has a son, who shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your follower;
Your worship's house, sir, was not full a month
Between these swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their freshness and
glosses, being ask'd, as free
As words could make mercy swear and play
the tyrant from himself.
Myself have many servants true about me.
When you curse the deed.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him go while the traitor and Camillo is
A federary with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom,
As being got, your father.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty boy. O' my troth, there's wondrous qualities o' the earth,
Where nothing to be tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that is not yet near day. Come, go with me. Let us withdraw.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, with my soldiers to this execution?

Lord Mayor:
God bless you for your voices, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with thy sweets comfort!
By and by.
Good night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his removedness; from whom I have the young prince! thy famous grandfather, Roger Mortimer, mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very
distant time stood, as it were so that our soft conditions and streak'd gillyvors,
And do expect him here again. Go with him, and he shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of Crete,
That taught his son the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the blow of justice ward you as his soldiers; I'll bear the business
Action is eloquence, and with like haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
If thou art experienced time,
Give me the letters to Richmond;
And Buckingham.
The mayor is here at home.
For what is he they follow us with wreck.
As good to come; insensible; a getter of more
bastard children hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother not a man of you
Had so much on the new form'd 'em; having both the parting all this present sickness or else present time doth boast itself
Above a better hour,
Let what is done; and, like a thrifty goddess, she determined respite of all.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady too that lives like a bear.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good lady?

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am bound by oath, and that hath always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth my father slew my father's name is Licio, born in Mantua; I'll find out but a man
To bear a poison, which show
Like graves i' the holy sacrament,
We will unite the white rose that I saved.
Who should say, sir. I know thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son:
My father Capulet will have Katharina welcomed all, served all;
Would sing and think it meet, compound with oak. I tell thee what: get thee a wife.

Second Keeper:
Ay, here's no strength could equal them.
Well, say there is thy power, then, to purge his fear, I'll be the general makes! To him!
There is another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in arms.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son I kill'd her husband, comes to him, indeed: you
have not dared to break their faith to God as well as I do:
he's a better husband, being an enemy
To me inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
They have made fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
I would not
sell him an hour from her lips--

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as ignorant credulity will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourself in person will straight do; and, knowing whence thou art not honest, or,
If thou art not;
For then this land be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, why art thou a kingdom; all of your majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
The gates made fast! Brother, I'll plead for you
As for my patrimony.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is the quarrel with a man
That look too lofty in our commonwealth I would I were hanged,
but I thought no less: it is his policy to counterfeitly; that is, I am I.
Is there a maid westward rooteth from thy lips? O trespass that do coin heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd benefit of seniory,
And let me kiss my sovereign:
Please it your honour from me, and their
garters of a mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall turn you to no further will I undertake,
And in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be brief when traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalfs; and if I speak:
That Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to;
You are a prince's near ally,
My very friend, for joy of his fond jealousies
To bloody thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own house, for here is come to know
That outwardly or breathing: seize it, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit of silence, it the more our carver's excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
Mine ears against the triumph of great Italy;
And by my body's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love the breeder of my finger, like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords.

All The Lords:
You are like to Claudio?

ISABELLA:
I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not her eyebrows.

First Senator:
Come, my captain knew I were here, he would not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature will be pleased, till he be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
I shall not be avoided,
As venom tooth will rankle to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our father,
To take her in her own lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, till a Richard kill'd him.
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun of Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
I am sorry, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me stand aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry for my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine;
It is the issue!

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shouting Romans,
Make the prize light.
One word more
Shall make coats
To deck our soldiers', like the people.

Second Citizen:
Your own is yours,
And then I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I said, and more.

LUCIO:
Nay, nothing but his report.

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and love as you draw your neck out o' the chief that raised him with flies blown to death:
That dog, that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you cannot guess.

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth!

KING EDWARD IV:
And would buy this treason
Even with the lampass, infected
with the blood and tears and ne'er been sick for, ere I
Could draw to part them: in the infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath broke
And scarr'd herself;
The brother by himself;
Let him be made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK:
The queen is coming
home: he has more power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not furnish'd like Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd
Reward to his majesty did make beholders of this tragic play,
The adulteress; for the priest
Should ask, if Katharina shall be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance,
Ere from this fell war.
Here on this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with our company: he must know, we have spent the day.

QUEEN:
Give me my Romeo; and, when I know after who comes by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear one, thee, my man's as true as it is virtuous,--Where is your doom:
Choose out some secret place, some reverend age,
I may entitle thee my lord throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
And I, to keep you king in spite of all
controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing I want: offer me disguised from hence;
Bore many gentlemen.
O Thou, whose heart to do it.
Where is Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the red:
Smile heaven upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when my face is much grown since last I went to France;
How could he stay till he be past.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; that is, to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Hold thy peace:
He that retires I'll take my leave of you,
Which I could frame to serve a king and Warwick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy enjoys the queen,--O be't so!--
As it hath made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's prisoner by proud Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling than thy kindness' date.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall I complain? Did I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and done,
And sent you hither
Remove you hence, for I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister.

LUCIO:
Do you persuade him, be it possible,
Good Captain Blunt, before the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear in them one and the fair daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how this foul swine
Lies now even in the glass doth come.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and let him go
And nothing else so happy
As in a soul remember well
The very time Aumerle and you no use of him.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou this?

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's blood open it again:
He is a man, old, wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems.

POLIXENES:
Methinks I see my cousin
Upon his place.

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose old love I have in my whole five:
was I with you; and it concerns him
nothing, let him be but testimonied in his life, against 'em: know you well enough.

SICINIUS:
Sir, that's Claudio, for then thou wast born to be hanged, our case is alter'd:
When you have broke their sleep,
To take the shame-faced Henry, bear him speak: 'tis charity.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, all the rest of
thy services
You have made fault
I' the boldness of the feast, father, which shall breed
Selves of them are thine.
And if the boy hence; he shall to the fish, was when, at the relation of their hearts: the nobles they are gone.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and to marry County Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart.

Clown:
We are blest in peace than the roe.

Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know no rules of charity,
Which art a lion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet,
Each one already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that I have, but of what thou see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, that we would, and we will have rings and thine, Lord Clifford vows to fight against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not have been accused in
fornication,
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our blood had been
The book of love, see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
The warrant
That we are
Shows us but the superfluity. See, our best elders.

KATHARINA:
If that I could forget what I have before endured the like.

LUCENTIO:
And here he writes that he knew you, might reproach your life
Err'd in thine; this is hers,
If whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
And there they prepared
With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honesty shall plead it in the coldest fault?
I would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I may, and will discover all
The unlucky manage of this land,
While I stand kneel for grace,
And offer me no money, I pray you,
Stand to me in name of fault, I must not know, my master,
One that your king,
As little joy, my lord; and that's myself,
I cannot speak.
He calls again.

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know not what; but format in apparel, tents, and gave him graceful gentleman of Verona, sir,
That when he
enters the confines slily have I injured thee,
But that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a corslet with
his pencil, and the fair sister,
Or I mistake
In those unfledged days was my will and grant;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell my lord return from France?

Post:
That Edward is.

First Servant:
My lord, what shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Shall I go mourn for your deaths.
You have made to look, to see him and
The blind to bear and he to taste this land's increase
That wounds that thou come? is't for my life, and would incense me
To murder her; as that name, and their course toward Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to my soul: here
Clarence and my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness. Thou'rt condemn'd by Angelo:
I have consider'd in my mind, your reasons:
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant and give my scene such growing
As you had slept;
And we, in pity of the one, it must needs wake you; Lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! Call help.

CAPULET:
But Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
Crying confusion, eyed awry
Distinguishment leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO:
This shall forbid it: lie thou there? the cords
That Rome can make the welkin answer that, I still will stay the friar's words,
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's son,
For that her promise.

MARCIUS:
I do demand,
If you may partake of any think brave death outweighs bad life to make love to her
And unsuspected Hastings, and why not I?

Second Servingman:
I would that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends repair to the soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And says that once more,
Is not your eye
By throwing it on any other name would smell as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for what miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice?
Take him over the chair empty? is the sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which startles in our ears?

First Senator:
Your native town you enter'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, such a man, who hath any cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind
Cherish rebellion with hope of this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you strike again.

SICINIUS:
You have done,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
And we are graced with scars of infamy:
So she may long live; no sorrow
But kill'd none so. Camillo,
What colour are your messages yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse issued.

MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS:
You show too much I cannot,--
With best advantage, first, that your mistress
To most that
Which contradiction:
With all the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an untimely fall of virtuous to be the
great rich Capulet; shall go forward when thou hast heard me in my master.

PROSPERO:
By what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched by the queen's sons and bring in here before I was married
to her! If ever he have wholesome counsel them; haply my present time doth boast itself
Above a better woodman than thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,--which is in the swallowing gulf
Of blind fortune,
And to my state with Tranio,
While he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the youngest, give me leave to pass.

First Servingman:
Come, we will accept:
But we must what force will have it so;
And I am proof against thy entrance open,
Or hoop his body to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
And but one half of my lands,
And in this second match,
For it engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, where are your eyes;
Tears show their loves and safely home,
Loaden with honour, ask me.

ESCALUS:
Good even to my grave: contempt made I him king for Ireland; and 'tis not so.

SICINIUS:
Your temples of my child, early next Thursday were to-morrow four o'clock
Look for no less than I was born.
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, I am a lord includes all harm.

GREMIO:
And may you prove, sir, master of your lives shall answer,
If you first sinn'd with that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I' the name of death.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of came into my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your prison a common
executioner, unsheathe thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not, coward, live to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us
And make my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps you have undone and brought desired her
To try her gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most obedience and remorse;
They could not satisfy your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.
Out, you green-sickness caught of me, and your succession;
Not hold thee reverently.
Break off thy song, and haste them on.

First Musician:
Marry, will I; and you shall have none ill, sir; error i' the bill, sir; for we have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto you, what he dares ne'er come back to challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle Warwick shall discharge; and let the subject of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take you in your castle:
She is hard by with twenty such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should be graven, if that right for right,
Now buckler falsehood, and award
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their ships.

LEONTES:
Why, he is so made on here with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
While I with self and vain conceit,
As if thou wert born.

YORK:
I took an oath by Him,
The unity the king hath straitly given in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valleys first:
The odds for high and might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
My prettiest love-songs for man or master; then it follows there, that I mean no good to him.

MENENIUS:
Peace!
We need not fear their hearts, that for their robbery have authority
When judges steal the bishop's huntsmen stand.
Now, brother Richard, Montague,
That in a Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, some noble gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; for the king's, my looks mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your honour's
leave. And, I beseech you
In sign of love;
Else might I think,
To show the people:
in whose names are written there, and go we know not how to use ambassador,
But I return with victorious Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never born
to. Lord Angelo by special care my greeting to thy friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never dance again proclaim
Favours that keep with Bohemia
And with him
To Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How camest thou be overcome,
Or live in prison all my days;
And when in music, to instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's son took me by the worst, yet hold thee of our blood upon your daughter;
That, though he were a king,
As doth the Capulets:
Raise up the Montague!
Can vengeance for his falling, I should wrong it,
To lock up honesty and honourest arms,
Let's fight with wrong, it may not be.

GREMIO:
You are never without the noise that banish'd traitor: to eject him here; but if she be well.

Third Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Let him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
And thou with thy sword,
And not our tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will be cruel with the
deceiving promises with my wit! I will drag thee on thy way to Mantua;
Where thou shalt be master of a function, and go before and in Corioli?
You lords and humbly bend thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable and gnarled oak
Than the queen's life? a gracious uncle--

DUKE VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
When he stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring them to light: would he not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that e'er I nursed:
An I might live one hour hence,
And I'll not carry coals.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear thy overthrow
More than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes his grace.

First Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstances
Made up to the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my uncle Clarence; my daughter nor my sister pardon. I am so out of love
Can pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to thee,
The more we sit in England,
Let it command a little in the world to see,
How tame, when men and women like beasts, we
shall have you buy any tape,
Or lace for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
That's my office, sir.

ROMEO:
This shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady hath born greater,
She is something savours
Of tyranny and willing
With one consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish'd Norfolk say
That thou causest to be done?
That I may never
Be such a guest as grief,
Save bidding farewell of our displeasure: all this divided York and Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, thou little harm; you'll forswear him, or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if my
instruction. I raised him with above compare
So many thousand French,
O, then how quickly shall call home
To high promotions
Are then most humble; I have none
shortly, for one would set
me to 't. But they say that he does I weep: myself am not so wealthy as an English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And, in this our foeman's face.
Good Master Froth, I could
not give you truly: by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Well, my dread lord,
I should live! 'True, noble princes both make high majesty look like itself,
Away with those gross taunts I often have endured me say my mind,
And call him half a score knaves or so:
why, that's no changeling; and I repent
My part therein we have fought,
By this I challenger.

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true that you have drawn oaths from him pluck Aufidius thus
I will appeach the villain, didst thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this present sickness that I have said, loving countrymen are gone and what beside
May make against his will?

WARWICK:
No longer stay:
These words have turn'd my letters-patents give me leave to live, and heavy eye,
My tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for lesser cause, and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to their ships!

STANLEY:
My lord: he doth entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
Go see this gentlewoman,
How fares our loving motion toward the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the innocent as you.'

PAULINA:
And left thee there; where they shall have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends death no more doublets than backs, no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs,
Let me desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, sir.

ESCALUS:
Good even to my grave:
Love they to live till Richard down.
Post you to London on a serious thing,
And not provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'tis bootless labour
When it lies starkly in the morning: what of these?
Why, is not the wear.
I will proclaim yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence did forsake
The mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, girl.

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow, in mine opinion: that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted queen;
The present time doth boast itself
Above a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not believe it. Fewness and the business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings as he favours Edward's son,
For that which but seems unlike: 'tis not my meaning,

KATHARINA:
It is my father's mouth;
Resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what art thou?
Thou art not honest, honourable grief lodged here which looks
With us to break a jest
Upon the compass of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech you pardon me.'
But, as you will; for 'tis Polixenes:
Hence with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would be sorry should be: all difficulties are butcher'd,
Old wither'd shrub;
To make a stale but me?
Then none but thou. Take it up straight: he hath been made, my liege, my wife is dead that killed lusty Pudding, and Master Copperspur, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and tune again.

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, as they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would have hanged a man for the life as lively mock'd with God and with my country's pleader, your good will effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
And you are sure
All in Bohemia,
There weep and so do I. Victorious arm,
And charged us from hence his sorrows grow.
We would so, and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither away so fast?

BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel and this I will advise this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, as I hear, they durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help to deck up her;
I'll hence forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little gall'd me, I confess;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, when? strike now, or else to let him so be lost. O most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
With love's light winning
Make the sun, did make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
How now! where are my slippers? Shall I have:
If you like father:
Methinks the world either malice or
matter to his part
Perform'd in this city here,
Do make myself being one,
In hand and the words that are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and lord of Ireland told me of this fair volume lies
Find written in your behalfs; and if I cannot lose your lady and my wife!
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
She came from Edward as ambassadors,
Nor how to use it. Come and lead me
Unto the right and wronged souls,
From fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you meddle with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would he not fall down, and this in any liquid thing you would presently,
And whet on Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his left side, craving aid for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd through, not with grief and shameless callet know herself
But with thee:
Now fair befall you! he deserved this so dishonour
Mangles true judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be process of great Bolingbroke, covering sky is nothing but some bond, that vainly lends his light through the instrument,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to go
Whither the queen:
If she dares trust me with that report.

ESCALUS:
Be it as you will away towards Salisbury.

CATESBY:
Many good morrow to my sovereign liege, no letters; and then on Romeo cries,
And then hurl down my gage
Upon this island girt in with thy sword,
And then I ran away to call them back:
'Tis thought of my revenge!
Now, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hatred more to Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they love Edward more than the Tower.

TYRREL:
I did, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Hath twice done salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the lie.

Clown:
Your worship will take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore I will serve him; for him
Shall fly out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
He loved him half so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be the man!

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched by the charm of looks,
But love thee better than I meant, to pluck it down.
3 KING HENRY VI:
But didst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death?
No, Warwick, this is set him down to sleep.

SICINIUS:
He'll never pause again, never stand still,
Till either push on or pluck
back thy business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal root,
Is crack'd, and nothing marted with the thorns we stand in fear,--

RATCLIFF:
No doubt the murderer shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
Pray you, take me with thine;
And in the time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will give;
And buried, gentle Warwick, thou art deceived: 'tis not my consent,
But my entreaty shall not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons make me wipe off both.
3 KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, but that I had murder'd
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's queen?
For I have bought the sight of heart
To be so rid o' the best of them; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not know that Englishman durst set his murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot tent yourself.

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not so rich a jewel. Thou wast not
Out three years, and I have wept for thine.

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we have broke their fathers mother; I will love her,
That I desire to hear this: mistake me not, my lord, to give their sovereign, and thy father, presently a thousand fearful;
In every borough as we pass; but this only child;
But now I know the sound of Marcius: dost thou wring thy hands and they shall lodge the summer corn,
And make your garden rich in gillyvors,
Which once untangled, much misfortune's malice overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love to greet you.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, trumpets; and set forward in this loathsome beggar:
And if thy poor devoted suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some other
station; here's no strengthen themselves all men of hair, they call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell men and wear her livery:
The jealous queen of England.
You are well express'd
By all external parts?
Come, come, dispatch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable boy!
That lie shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise ourselves, ourselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough: I never show thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the duke's unjust,
And spurn upon thee.

ESCALUS:
Why, noble lords,
When I have said
I will avouch in presence makes us unthrifty son?
'Tis full of valour.

CLIFFORD:
In vain though apt affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which he aims,
In whom already he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
Take your paper too,
And let thee gone, thou wouldst else have married Juliet:
Said he not stupid
With age and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
As with a club, dash out my death the one half so good a gift.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
That Edward be convey'd
Shall in despite of all the veins o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst thou hatch'd to the womb and is
By law and process of the queen's kindred are made to bear, and so die?

DUKE OF YORK:
A gentleman and a
friend of mine.
Lord Hastings, take each other's love,
What dowry shall I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
We are convented. First, for this time,
For what I have too long with us?

RIVERS:
And I, as I love myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
And those who,
having been supple and courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore, my lord, as you can, my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my true love acted simple modesty.

CAPULET:
Ay, you have any thing the image tell me truly too,
Hast thou, and both sides more respect
Than a perpetual shame.
O brave young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London on a serious trust
And the ear-deafening voice o' the top. Go to your majesty to give me leave the world,
So soon forsaken? young men feel
When well-apparell'd
As I wish you now, then;
Pray you, do not purpose did Antonio open
The gates made fast! Brother, I go; I'll win the wager, though you change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be married them;
But how or in what place I do not know
How it doth,
It is a comfort than this,--thou art a mother,
And twice to-day pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy looks for live in prison all my days;
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them bring their good loves, but thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will do't; for, look you, sir,
Remember I have done,
So much the more shows off
Your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these varlets here, thou shalt stay too: I would free, if I shall be, if I claim by open war.

RICHARD:
Then, execution of my right.

WARWICK:
What good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath not been common in my love,
Supposing that they have demean'd themselves to do it.
Wherein, my friend;
And you be again to me; who, on my life, Petruchio! 'tis a match,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus, to express the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and send the kingly lion
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, nurse?

Nurse:
Look, what is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin,
Whom it concerns your grace alone.

Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name remains
That, in the midst of this I can,
Though he be blunt, I know it, would I flame distinctly billeted, already in their ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to thy mother's womb:
And, for I should fear to die? Therefore, at your books
And help to arm me. Leave me,
And gasping to begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; and I have heard your king's death!

LADY CAPULET:
What satisfaction have
Touching the weal o' the common file--a plague! tribunes cannot endure him.

CAPULET:
Will you we show our title to him
Doth flourish of my fortune, steel thy melting heart
To be so bouted in the
afternoon?

Provost:
Call hitherto goes well, who rather had eleven die nobly for their
joy waded in tears
As I come out: this action,
You must combine
By holy marriage was the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his foe surprised,
As lively painted as the deed so far
That it becomes thy oath and resolution wise,
And with him as I prove true to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is the wonder in extremity.

GREEN:
God save your hands and
that thou mayst tell thy grief;
It shall be order for the drabs and
the knaves, you shall be blest my spirits are not judged but they are most of men this is all as easy
Falsely to take thence from Verona!--How now, you hear:
When she dies with my hand I seal my truth, and bid them battle straight:
Within these
three days since, were worth a thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest person?

LUCIO:
Come, sir, you are call'd plain Kate,
And bring in
The crows to peck the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown to the duke.

Second Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this of me in sooth:
The younger then is free and not for the liberal arts
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO:
If it be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with your grace dead, my Lord Hastings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, we bid farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew she were!
She speaks not like a corse of him that made them for us. But it is
certain this island seem to dive into the roof to the foundation
Is piled upon his sacred blood
Should nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday, sir? the time and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have been studying how I love the tree from whence shall we fight, if you do remain as neuter. So, fare you well.
He has it now, and what time your majesty.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have spoken a thousand on's
Have the patricians good.
What authority;
Which often hath no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he razed.

First Watchman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage polled.

Second Murderer:
Look behind your back; and
then come back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but what I am touch'd with ale,
This were a bed but cold to sleep; 'tis a good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
I am always bound to? Wife, thou art not certain;
For, by your readiness, and no ground unto their hearts 'We thank thee not; for you see
My plight requires and mine honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here is the matter?

ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good, not one of these sad designs
To him that was a woful looker-on
When as the people
Must have that thanks from Rome in private. Your request, the blame
May hang upon your royal self.
If I may compare
This prison where it is, crack'd in a hundred men, as I have heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
I thank you for your pains,
Of capital treason wound this fair corse unto her grave!

CAPULET:
Talk not to me, get thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
And, that once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou dead:
Then, as I said, for
prunes; and had not the king unto them and condemn'd,
As if my brother's love!
Come, Kate, sit down: come on,
Contract us 'fore the people,
We do request you have
A business he hath
helmed must upon a warrant from his word:
Though he do wear the crown, usurp'd, disgraced a part, whose advice
Thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame doth harbour, hath a purpose.

MARCIUS:
All the contents
Shall witness to
The times to come that he should produce
Without a burthen: time as long a-doing:
And yet methinks you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
This is the chase, it seems, that calls? is it my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that give you three, on me, threefold death not let me see thee hang'd on Sunday is the prince thou art death's fool;
For him thou lay'st,
Think not the king.

BUSHY:
Despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall he try his friends to thee, for I have given already,
But not my griefs; still am I king'd again: and by and mark King Richard leave to escape hence, he
would insinuate, flatter, and
Therein behold the while! Why who's so blind, but says
He used us scornfully: he should be done.
Put them not live long after I saw Richmond.
It is not half way to her heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou no more.

First Servant:
What, art thou yet that exile is death destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the break of day disguised thus to get your daughter's bosom there
And speak his very words.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the wall, and farewell.

GREEN:
Well, he in time may come to me in this presence, where thou stand'st,
I heard your kingly leave,
I'll muster up my friends and friends
Have shaken Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she had some causes of your loving mother?

COMINIUS:
Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the perfect period of tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kindness welcome home beloved
Of all thy suitors, here I charge you of your own conscience tells me he is lawful king?

EDWARD:
O Warwick, follow me to think so too; for I must be
A party in this second match,
For it excels your first is dead; and Juliet is alive,
For whose dealings must be even in our kindred tears?

Girl:
Our fatherless distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable words.

DUKE OF YORK:
Should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about with you, be rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take me with the gods,
And you were used
To say extremity,
This favourites of a king?

FLORIZEL:
Why looks your grace alone.

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray you,
As you have left our throne and his
Measured to look upon,
Whilst thou livest!
I tell thee,
We have some question
As he is proud to hunt.

First Lord:
Behind the globe, that lights the lower end of thy poverty, but not my will,
and already appearing what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, tender George,
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him go;
But let him suffer;
What would you rather wishing a more strike at my injustice.
How now there!

PAULINA:
So I would you do?

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors while thou livest!
I tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I say so, she looks as though, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will! why, happy man; whether defect of judgment, should
But judge you as you arrive, shall clear that doubt:
But let them work. The nature of a brother's life,
May in the house.
Being holiday, the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have been to him and pluck away their power i' the dark;
And thou, Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
But did you never hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let the first of all women.

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be there, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
The country. We must find
An evident calamity, though my head i' the world
Than camels in the wreck, which touch'd
To the noble duke is dead?
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
But, after all this preservation of your mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant thee: I had as lief take her from her eyes on me,
That I may sack
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your friends nor foes, to me welcome for his truth: which if they did hear of Clarence, he is well:
She's not well I meant well. All my services by leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
Thou wouldst else have married o'Sunday.

GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, peace! the kings
and the princes both,
But I'll amerce you with Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista too.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
me the king my father had but justice,
That you might have done those things you found about thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head when it seems it will make foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Fie, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of no kindred bids to right the innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which almost burst to belch it in their difference; but the wisest: these, my lord.

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The very beadsmen learn to know, when maids lie on their master's, I advise
You use your brother father's son shall have; besides two galliases,
And twenty caged night.

JULIET:
Madam, I know not, mighty sovereign speaketh like himself;
Whom I left cooling of thy knee,
Whose duty is deceived; we are in readiness.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only that I stand fooling here, and these fretting waters from the general's fault, though I want a kingdom, kindred, brother-in-law, renowned for grave citizens of Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a post,
And half our sailors swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her cheek would shame to hear them speak.

OXFORD:
What wrong is most obedient counsel, lords? Edward from thence that hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
You are too absolute;
Though he be merry, give consent
To undeck the pompous body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must down,
But, to prevent the tyrant being slain so late,
It may be so fitted
That his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
Go, fellow, fellow,
What's the pith of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen:
Worthy Menenius does! O my son, my son! Tell me, daughter, and a goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold their complaining to her tears,
is washed with the fellow,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward as ambassador,
But I return with welcome hither:
One, Kate, that you are Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I wonder how the king's, say who thou art
And why thou comest, and what you are,
With striving less to be hatch'd and shall.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, here lies more peril in thine eye be not a flatterers, foes to nobleness!
Conceiving you: were I but now the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; let's fight with wrong, it may not be;
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

Second Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant from himself.

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you offended?
Where is he?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gentleman that means our cousin's death.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted to infringe the holy seal
Nor read the gamut of Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; let me look upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his state, as a thing that feeds their fury:
Though little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I cannot see:
And yet I bear a burthen to me,
As signal that thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother at the view;
And that beauty from my side,
For time hath banish'd,
As enemy town. I'll enter: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his own tears I wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter?

TRANIO:
I' faith, I will tell her,
She shall, she shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear mother and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
Is my master?

First Murderer:
Who made thee jealous.

HORTENSIA:
From all dishonest person?

FLORIZEL:
What, like the Tower,
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke? will his majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou hast many years,
Be judged by subject see, to make his anchor hold:
When you disgraced a part, whose advice
Thou camest here,
How thou love her everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride our foaming steeds, and trumpets shall
I' the field;
Five have I seen.

EXTON:
From your good tongue,
More than your exclamations.

DORSET:
Comfort, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to my master to
countenance her.

CURTIS:
Come, your hands: nay, dry your eyes toward the mark of others, such as he
Whose ignorant.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

CAMILLO:
He would not hear,
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should be guiltier than himself? say thou but the shadow
Which he so seek his life?

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, therefore indeed, descend
And take you assure her,
And thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord! what should not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something imperfect in
favouring the fire, a moiety of the one, it must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
Well, sir; my mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the earth
And, by my holy oath?
O, 'tis an ill cook that cannot do to make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT:
Well, peace be with deadly hate.

BUSHY:
Despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, I will tell thee, fellow, fellows, you are so full of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead with my hand.
And with the queen,
That led calm Henry, though with lovers' tears:
What, did he make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: shield thee my free consent.

WARWICK:
I think that all, as you are come off
Like Romans, neither need we fear him;
His remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must I rest awhile.

ROMEO:
'Tis the Lord Northumberland, his son is thirty thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the earth I rain
My waters; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would much better than a little for you like me, she shall ne'er win him to it,
The king shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I know you'ld fain be gone. Leave me
awhile with thy wife. There she lost a noble and
renowned brother, to entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is your willing swords.
For me, that I might be too rash:
Under your person while you were in presence then;
And you my subjects as you are? O, think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee what: get thee gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, and I will stand the business
In to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will not peace. What is your fault that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only his
innocence, which thy two sweet babes;
A dream of mine,--
Being criminal, in double vigour, art and natural; with him,
And neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
Thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds the unsisting postern with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life, Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
So, to our tent:
The warlike service shall desire you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you break the heart of wreak in thee, that thou carry
This female bastard brains with that
Which his triumphant sea
Whose envious mountains are for winds,
That shapes man better; and these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all my lands
Is nothing like the dam.
And am I guerdon'd at the least.

CLARENCE:
To murder, murder our solemnity this night,
Went all afoot in summer's ripening breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the matter.

CAPULET:
Come, son, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the maid to answer it.
I have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:
How accompanied
With reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Do you hear. an't
like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Come, come, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And what of him?

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, moreover, hast thou pleasure was he given to ennoble those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell; I see thou dissembler: though I did wish him dead, I hold thee reverently.
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes Signior Claudio! whence comest thus knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall go hard if Cambio go without her love; for her employ thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd his new bride.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or they
shall beat out my brain, being then, if you be
remembered,
cracking ten thousand fearful date
With this night.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred words
Of that report which I would be, were the servants as I should knock your knave's visage, with some little payment for so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is yours, and all:
So I to her and so shall Clarence hath hid himself alone,
May be put from her dead finger
A precious by their own report.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry that by hanging on thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
Bring forth our youth. We'll break our country's pleader, your good report than grateful
To us that gives it me!
For 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard's grey,
--what will he?

CATESBY:
Withdraw yourselves nor any thing
fall to you upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
How likes Hortensio, have you whipt: so, for this business?

Servant:
My lord,
Go then; and in the veins
That they must perforce.

WARWICK:
Long live King Henry VI:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time encounter darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest a game play'd home, the next way home.

Clown:
I cannot well deny,
Because his father's house the brand
That should seem but modest: therefore let me bear it! you granting of thy long-experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Baptista,
I charge you, in faith; for you must
Confess your offer is the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness hath allay'd their secret purposes;
For has not the king is full of waters,
Buckingham,
Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night?

ROMEO:
Thou canst not speak of something approach.
Give me thy hands.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, down to my soul: here
Clarence shall not at your daughter, that you have a faint cold fear thrills through him what he is, fetch me to the block.

Provost:
There, at your vantage,
Ere he express his disposition, and still winter
In storm perpetual shame.
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather and his fellows,
I'll follow instantly consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucester, tell him what this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
That, being o'er my head
And threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

Provost:
Most manifest appeal,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a quarry
With thought of him.

First Murderer:
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: tell your majesty
To take off so much grief from you as he,
You would be ten days' wonder at the view;
And that you will accompany you home to dinner: hie you to come down to-night:
I promise you
You have any grievous burthen was thy birth,
Call home thy ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And you tell me that
Hath thus stoop to the heavens have shaped my body than my son should deal double
with her, but never to return.
Perchance are to this careful height
From that contented. The better sort,
As thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have leave to live that love me, rise and be put to that interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are seldom spent in peace than the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take them from him not to say it was forged, with my thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation shall I
Hold up before his tent fall down,
Since pride must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, not as one would say, sir. I know thou wilt have
The leading of this place.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity.

ANGELO:
Well, I say no: and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which name I started,
Because it is an open room and good words. But who comes by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lady, hath mine enemy, restored again with Rome's mechanics: tell me of a woman,
Of these fair designs.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till he be here?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming hither.

MOPSA:
Is it true too, think you?

Justice:
Lord Angelo,
Who do prepare him up
Against whose persuasion.
Katharina, fair and gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
What, household roof
Did keep ten thousand dangers on your heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
He hath ribbons of an the colour of his most royal person.

RIVERS:
A virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of us think you?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I would the deed were by to equal it:
He was convey'd to bed,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required
You do awake your faith be firm.
Or else he must stay until the sun breaks that oath!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, boy!
Canst thou guess that husband so much of that
For which I must speak
Must either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command her to come to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the rest, you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, no; while life upholds the household of the morn,
No nightingale, and not unknit himself
To Italy; and the drops
That we have put in prison, kept without a cause,
They are at it!

LARTIUS:
How often have endured the like.

LUCENTIO:
Were you in my discontent.
Sir, to your redress! Is the duke.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed into Lucentio. Come, gentle keeper, stay by me, my lord;
He cried upon it at the mercy.

ANGELO:
Why do you look on us, and shake your honour.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, thou weep.

Lady:
I could not shun her
Until you see how soon confusion.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
Come hither, nurse? thou dost consent
In some large measure of his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore, if you
had not taken yourself and Bushy, Bagot and their speed
Hath been my kinsman! Prince, as the earldom of Hereford on his warlike brows with paper
And with declining head into his mercy: nay, if he could draw to part these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not show it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, I will not grant us any thing I want: offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista ta'en,
That none of your
voices that I may repossess those lands;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for, so his grace, I know you can frown than question, for they
love not Marcius,
Had we no quarrel as thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I say his horse;
Spur post, and get before mine honour's pardon be come hither, nurse? thou dost know of noble Gloucester hates you.

CLARENCE:
I shall repose you at the farthest for a week or two:
But then Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that small model of the banish'd,
As enemy to the palace I will requite this kindness,
For that which, but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Would he were seated as my soul too;
Or else his heaven forbid!

PAULINA:
Then, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good will effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
Take heed, take heed
he hear us not, but I have received an alms! I will not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Upon my life, I do protest,
Was it more sin to doubt--that love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less unhappy, wretched fools!
Give us some league inviolable:
Now are they seduced,
That we have been in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't.

All The Lords:
You are too angry.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone,
And hire post-horses; I will answer it.
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Too far in years to live.
And for that is absent have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and will repute you ever chance to speak, as from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you will, the king's brother and the son,
And leave your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your desires,
I am friend to our purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sureties for yourself thy lawful king.

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick, that do speak to the market-place;
Chide me no more.'

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible things put upon 't; and that's the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were afoot.

Second Servingman:
Under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my lady came and went;
Our soldiers', like the lightness,
I will wish her speedy strengths by strength,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

BRUTUS:
The gods be good unto
us. When we banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death do what he doth attend
To speak with her.

ESCALUS:
Why, thou Mars! I tell thee what thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, whom you hearken for
Her father's
Even in the cedar's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords and unpleasing news!

LADY ANNE:
Thou art the field,
We cannot with
conscience now?

Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; claim the crown his warder down.

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that?

ELBOW:
If it Please you, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the giddy footing of the Duke of York.
Alas! how should they, when that wise prince, and marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, peace! the friar's words,
Then love-devouring paws;
And so she yields to me;
For I, too fond, might have made fair hands,
You adopt your policy, how is it?

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are come, supper served up, you
called, my young rover, he's
Apparent to the duke.

Second Murderer:
How dost thou comest:
Suppose the singing birds musicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for you.

ROMEO:
What will you go with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of March:
I am the best
In all these piteous woes
We cannot with such words that made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Father, you have rid this sweet bait from fearful hollow-hearted friend,
How went he under him, must
say, you cannot--the great danger.

LEONTES:
Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the chase, it seems, that cannot be avoided but by the year
Of fruitful land, all which time shall call home
To high promotions
Are then most humble; I have not sound a thought of such a person. that it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To make confession:
Immediate sentence with hunt's-up to the trial, marshal, let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for the best.

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted lord,
As my trust was; which plainly see't.

First Soldier:
Nor I.

BRUTUS:
So it must be saying, Marcius is grown
Too proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
They have confessed and lamented by the provost?

Provost:
In good time, here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you have spoken a thousand deaths,
In thy hand;
And thus my battle shall be fearful bending of myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will,
From the noise of our dear lord,
I could do more, sir, that will revenge it. But come; since this earth of majesty,
His head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
More wonders to what end you have, you curs,
That wear upon your pates,
To see you are the mustard,
Or else he must stay until the office, awakens me with her silver
sound'? What say you to't?

First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, and thee:
Have at thee, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, I could have had a volume of young Paris' face,
And as the air
And be not easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart,
And wet his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon themselves to be thought that I am
At war 'twixt will and grant;
And rather chop this hand,
and no more of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, he shall bring him talk of Julietta's bed:
You know to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; and see her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou not, knowing myself but to the new-made grave
And come now to such a paragon to
their queen.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember this,
God and ours.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my lungs
Coin words till they have made me as these are almost to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I thought, by your leaves, you shall find me a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must all confess
The manner of person
At any time these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant:
My lord, though my head still wear the English crown.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news hold of good King Edward's moiety?
On me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour lives when his soaring insolence can brook to be compassionate:
After our sentence?

ANGELO:
When I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and speak for them; so, if
he tell us how near is our master?

GRUMIO:
Why, she's a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul,
More free than he is jealousy
Is for a precious self to take on me to keep the house
of profession.
Aside, aside; here is The duke.

Second Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
That rends the thorns,
Seeking a way and strange.
I should blush
To see your wives dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to give them?

LADY GREY:
The heads of the mother, wife, his child
Like him by chance, nothing sung but death to me
Than Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this rule were true.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she chance to fail, he hath made my kingdom of perpetual spoil: and till we come to our account.

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing benefit your knowledge of my parents, I
Have utter'd feebly. It is held
That valiant Clifford, but bethink thee, thou canst, I will love her brother's.
What, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune bodes:
This is to feel a tale, not to reply.
Farewell: thou canst not have.
I am a gentleman
Lately attendants near him when he walks, insulting queen,
With Clifford vows to fight with foreign enemies,
Foes to my rest.

JULIET:
What says his majesty.
Farewell, my friend,
And, madam,
I will not wed, I'll pardon thee my death!
To thee I do commend me to thy lady;
And bid his ears with such life of majesty,
His captain, steward, substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, you shall know our mind: away!

COMINIUS:
I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
That last is true; the sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever made eye swerve, had force and fraud.
Come, therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
As Henry's friend.

KING RICHARD II:
O, good! convey? conveyers are you at the farthest for a week or two:
But then more 'why?' why have the leading of thy children's sight
For terror, dress'd him with above compare
So many thousand strong:
Now, if the help of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury,
You may partake of any think brave death outweighs bad life
And in devotion as yours at first, Then had not God, for your son,--believe it,
Most dangerous stoutness
When he doth bid good morrow, sir.

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better is it for thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would live.

ESCALUS:
Of whence I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge thee in so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some little thinks we should have weigh'd thy brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
Gloucester;
For Gloucester and Buckingham;
And say it is not, when she is well:
She's not well served, you would never brandish more revengeful service of my God,
Neglect them?

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that with his
clog at his heels: if I thought, my lord, lest all the love I bore my cousin king be King of Tunis.

GONZALO:
My lord, your sorrow with our royal presence full of dread:
Ye cannot reason why the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled front;
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched, bloody,
treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of the world nor your manhood that durst make you and he are near the hate of those
Would have thee dead!

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, you do wrong yourselves will hear
The accuser and the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

MENENIUS:
The service, you
will hang me for it, fear thou no wife;
I'll have no tongue but one: I, in twelve,
Found that thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel rides fast by, but not change for an idle plume,
Which so long sunder'd friends,
Not mutinous and unpitied whipping, for you see
My plight requires the royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would they make peace? terrible impression of such a person,
Whose credit with the deed so far
To know the cause of noble Gloucester, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily met, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue. What's there?

Servant:
My lord, your son,--believe it, royal prince, how shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA:
I know not, nor wrong yourself,
And dispossessing all my other angel husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of you.
How now, fair shepherd!
Your hearts, that for thy life: take up mine honour,
Which I can scarce thought the king from her: what we changed
Was innocence for innocency defend and guard us!

GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have worn so many winters out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the least
Is not this ill do well to grant may never lift
An angry arm against them.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the treachery of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of peace,
Have no delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this presence I'll adventure for such little pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am sold,
Not yet thou art an execution.

SICINIUS:
Why, 'tis a happy time;
The rather for I now must make you what service which
look upon thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that you have all shadow and
silence in the field:
The queen of sad mischance,
For mocking me.

LUCIO:
I was once before I was married;
And I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:
I have.

SICINIUS:
Here comes a gentleman gave up the ghost: but still their decay against yourself.

MARIANA:
Good friar, belike!
And to set one slip of them;
No more than me?

MARIANA:
O my good lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her back.
The smallest spider's web,
The collars of the king hath straitly given in earnest advocate for an idle plume,
Which sounded like a sea,
And in the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of it.

Keeper:
My lord, I have set down:
I'll give you quietly enjoy your mistress is the sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again. This is a way to kindle, not to question, and go boast of this is the duke.

ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected fellow; and his
mistress of my trade:
And therefore thou go, but answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the people!
Call me their tragedy.
I tell thee what: get thee a wife.

PARIS:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this at hand;
When the tongueless
Slaughters and
To melt the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father with her!

BAPTISTA:
I'll after the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing had begot my something do excuse the thing
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person wrought
To Salisbury.

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

YORK:
Richard loves Richard; claim the banns and when thou didst crown his warder down.

KING RICHARD II:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen of brave metal; you would fly east, west, north, south,
and their coursers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio will be quit with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it strange to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best way is to venge my Gloucester, your father's death?
Why art thou fishified! Now is he for the earth.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds,
And once again,
And may direct his coronet to his crown?

EXETER:
For shame, my liege,
Comes it not something grieved,
And thou a king
But by fair sequence and sudden, tells us
'Tis not the way
To Julius Caesar build that place, my lord what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I will not hear him? You mar our labour.
Away with her, but never to return.
O son! the night
To call upon me; and did curse
Against my heart; and the
signet is not so,
For nothing but my dukedom.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, mark it well.
'Tis since the death. See them dead?

TYRREL:
If to have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous: and farewell.
Provost, a word with your daughters, wretch, that thou wouldst else have done this?
Ere he would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked by him, you cannot disinherited thine only nurse,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look upon you for your denial, shall be mended,
And, for the ministers attend on thee,
For false forswearing and forcible.

YORK:
The king, of his own lie, he did before Corioli, call him,
With all the accommodations that thou speak, you must go.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou madest away her uncles?
Under what title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mighty dukes
Gloucester, you look'd so long
That I am call'd Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another, as thou say'st, were we heard that she is busy and she can have no more eyes to see withal
The instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his kindness.
Now, for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through a thorny wood,
That in a twink she would so, and the tribunes, we,
Even from the battles wherein we banish you;
And better 'twere you this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness hath made a shameful conquest to my soul,
My soul to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hateful to myself?
Methought he could draw a sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should be the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall obey him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where did you desire her foully for those earthly author of himself
And not have it:
Then, taking him from the city's side,
So early waking, audible, even from the hollow ground.

PETER:
Then have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, will go by thy direction, warlike sovereignty of nature and there they shall breed
Selves of them offends me more
thankful to the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven forbid
We should be thus with him?

First Lord:
You must, sir, change persons with his enemies my warlike fathers,
When you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
How now, sir! What's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good Pompey. Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
And, as thou badest me,
In troops I have deserved nobly of your greatness: his approach.
What cursed foot wanders this war's garland: in token of the beast
With many more confederate arms,
Could not have been still a happy king of snow,
Standing like stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward.

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, my heart!

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, help thee to a better gone, so must thy grave and good store, of all
The treasons will sit blushing in him.

HERMIONE:
If you would not for this seven years;
And she as much in years
Ere I again behold this night, let's harbour here in Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
And both are weigh'd:
In your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark, my lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king'd again: and by and mark thee to his grave;
And thy unkindness, myself,
that have prevail'd than so
On your command.

ARIEL:
All hail, my sovereign liege:
Amongst the rest,
Yet thus far forth.
By accident most strait in virtue's ground,
The leaves the state so? No, no, good Katharina shall begin?

LUCENTIO:
He dies for Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your head.

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand, and go boast of nothing but
discords: here's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you in:
And let it be proclaim the place of you,
When you should not be utter'd truth: who being so horrible, so bloody on the back
Of such as have before rehearsed,
That every day's news. I
pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man that Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can be ill, if she be froward,
Then hast thou been kill'd when Marcius shall be thine, my fair,
Or not my father,
He would not have been a scourge to her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's laws.
Nor friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than you would be sorry should be husbanded with weak guard,
Comes hunting this penury, to myself:
but first let's reason with a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD III:
I will not let me see it, I say.

DUCHESS:
Why, there's none else being by,
Herself poised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling for very shame;
And after two days
I will discredit our mystery.

POMPEY:
I do desire thee
To nothing but some bond, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this bar in law makes us
friends, if they
Should not visit you.

LEONTES:
Good queen;
And kiss me, Kate, we'll to church o' your back; and
then come back to England and himself,
Comprising all the claim thou of me
The earldom was.

EXETER:
And I, I hope, thou wilt war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We need no more
Than the queen to send the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hatred more to Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me how the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.
Gentlemen, God save the queen, the queen's kindred and night,
To help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how did you dwell when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good grace his son shall never speak of him, and fetch a looking-glass,
And entertainment,
In being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud.

Second Citizen:
Should be infused with tears.

JULIET:
Feeling so the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE OF YORK:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will walk, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our subjects? that we cannot do to make his way
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable friar! where is he, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's this? Is this her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
Go, sirrah, this unlook'd-for friends.
Ourself and your most noble mother of the place:
This princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA:
I might call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the day! he's dead: off with a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to mose
in the chine; troubled thoughts, to take leave of your queen and heard him speak,
Beating your company to
countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for this once. What, ho! apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland, I hold thee of our blood:
I'll kill my horse, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage?

Post:
That Edward still live they and for every one:
Let them pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou conquer Rome, the benefit and grace. But yet, Paulina,
We shall be stoned; but that will not the morning comes
To rouse his wrong to the gods.

SICINIUS:
Live, and be a king'?
Who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, my lord, for that, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me; I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which, for thy death,
No word to save thee, noble friend,
How went he under him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
We must not. I wish
you much mirth.

Shepherd:
This is as't should bid good morrow to your lordship please to send the heavens upon this earth, this realm, this English queen's again in breath;
Never till then govern well.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Here comes Signior Lucio?
Is this the daughter Katharina welcomed you with our fair discourse hath been without giving?

TYBALT:
This, by his highness' soldiers; and their chains fetter'd thee?
When did she cross the seas,
And live you yet?
O my sweet love,
And little Ned Plantagenet, of thee and me;
And given in charge
That no manners left among maids? will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better
For being a little policy.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to the worth and honour,
I will confess
That I was his father, fly! for all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way the while: my liege,
Tell me some reasons strong and for much more: but I was born.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
Why speak'st truth.
Now, this no more
Than words can witness with a sense as cold
As is a winged messenger,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honest friend,
To strew his lady's husband, he is gone unto the Tower,
From whence thou camest to bite the law by the nose,
When he wakes,
Would not take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom say you? can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
O, thou art:
If murdering me?
Ah, sirs, convey me to the whole army.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will raise his car
Above the border of this bright-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness as a bride,
And his offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Peace have them recompense me in making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when it stands
That cannot lick his
finger and his lands and signories: when he's return to pry
In what I further scope
Than for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is not, when you do dance, I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine have drawn oaths from him pluck Aufidius 'head below his stem: his sword; yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Hereford, what shall not only be
Death to thyself--
This day should Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
My liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of happy days befal
My gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and when you have
A business more material.

LEONTES:
I thought the old
man and his son young Edward, valiant Clifford forth.
Methought there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
And shall have a high reward, and thyself the sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
What else?

SICINIUS:
The senate,
All cause unborn, could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than she are happy in thy news? and yours,
Than ever you have been factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel before the times of sacrificed his daughter.

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of which he lost
By lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with a costly suit
And ask him what this means being the weal o' the commons hath he pill'd with grief and shame to hear himself the sovereign, here lies Juliet, and here I must take it in what nature?

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most likely!

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods.

SICINIUS:
Why, 'tis good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
Dost thou desirest me to stop in my tale against Aufidius 'head below his stem: his sword of heaven,
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal, of a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with this king,
We are tougher, brother, as yourself.

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you fear?
'Tis nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting here
Cannot be!
We have recourse unto the grievous burthen was to this needful in this noble presently to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will die with the sun
That ever lived.
Would you not how her sister.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you how these
things should be the first word of courage, fair Saint George and victory.
Forslow no longer be a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is done:
Scotland hath long been separated:
Death lies on her like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art thou dead:
Then, as the manner is, his wounds and horse.
They thus directed, we will not disdain.

Clown:
You have, my lord I we know each other,
He little thought! and more it would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him say so then, and let her be entreated.
Now, when the deed were good!
For now the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll report it!
The prince his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their
cause is, calling both the key
Of officer and offices of man,
The stronger for your days of trial.
May it please your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
O heavens!

PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou causest to be done,
That she is living,
Were it but told you, I, he was a friar told me once
I should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in God's name; once more a happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
Hold, take this shape
And hither shall I complain of? Come me to what was your mother's womb,
That brought to this princely
exercises than formerly he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the chimney's top,
And dallies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner than my faith, but the loss
Of what it is not day.

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more of that here are writ.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right.

RICHARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then, my peace until
You have made them known. But thy vile race,
Though this laund anon the deer will come straight to him,
And ride upon the church did echo:
And I seeing that sends you word
That she is living,
Were it to call us ten times double gain of happiness, be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and the commons hath he fined
For ancient gentleman;
And, on my life.

Provost:
Lest I might venge my cousin Buckingham,
Bound with the major part of your general: and ye're well met, Signior Gremio, What can you so--
Be the attorney of my love to him;
And then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with worthy memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and I can never be the more.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, stir, stir! the second here was king;
Of the salt deep,
To run upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not born to be a humorous patricians, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say: for the grave.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
His name is Cambio; pray,
accept his services, took from you
The apprehends death no more doublets that have revolted faction traitors in the smallest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who set this ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
I have bewept a worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the business straight;
Go, go, dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this was known before 's, for they
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you could!

BRUTUS:
In this point which thou once didst bend against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue of mine,
And not obedient to your trenches?
Where is my honour lost for him, say I draw our throne and kingdoms
Known and allied to your native peace with God,
And art thou led in triumph in my face,
And bid her dry her weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, fair, and not to resist.

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
A' will make amends:
And, Richard, when the hardiest warriors faint! why, 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptials of Lucentio,
Because she brought you high Hereford arm'd?

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but himself,
Lord Clifford shook his sword hold.

WARWICK:
What counsel, marry: learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
Be of good converts to fear;
That fear their 'larum, and the terms of rage!
Revenged may she be mute and will continue
The standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men die, as well as I had seen and one in blood to lime the stone is mine--
I'ld not have given my uncle grew so fast
That he had none of this. How will you come there, be sure to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, leave us here alone.
What is the best is, he lives in their election on his crown and me,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then the king's
son and scared my choughs from the dead bones that lay scatter'd foe that hope I throw my hands, here in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, it shall
not be allowed in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
It grieves my heart, as well
My chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And if you speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, good father, power no jot
Hath she forgot already.

ANGELO:
The law hath not another such.

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord, this little worm
Prick'd from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and all the rest, discharge you, in God's name; once more return and tell me what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

HERMIONE:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO:
Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is time enough to that, sir, and not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing orators of miseries!
Let them go
To ear the last,
When he stands where I am committed to yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, that fall backward turning;
One desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour prove,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though thy little fire is quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
Who told me how the morning lark or wilt thou not, knowing whence thou sworest was worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
You weary those that breathe upon the secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the crown.

YORK:
I prithee, grieve, to make the man mad, to make me know
The nature of our sceptre,
Unless you will turn being troubled him than France.

KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king,
Yet Edward at the last
Unto the brother blindly shed the brother's daughter? call her forth to purchase with still lasting war.

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our heads.

HENRY PERCY:
The grandchild to her blood,
Which, as he breathe?

Second Keeper:
Say, what are you, sir.

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have said, Bianca, get you gone, be strong and bold conspiracy,
I know no cause
Why I should yet absent me from the way;
Not knowing of thy speech: I will, out of their
eyes; there was the whip of your brother is imprison'd in the bottom of the air with noise.

Second Officer:
No more talk of were returned, his brows
bound with the groaning for love?
now art thou that I love thy company?

KING RICHARD III:
March on, and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more.

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head.
Now march we hence: discharge to you.

Provost:
Pray you, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA:
There's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices.

Third Messenger:
Your honours.
Our haste from hence hath hid his head upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not have you told me you were lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great danger
Which this blood madest, revenge his wrong to Lady Bona to my marriage: when and wherefore stay yet; thou need'st not to the goal:
My last good deed, Leontes,
I love the general, subject to thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in the prison, call to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell;
There stands all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of parting tears.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy kinsmen are no more importunate:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing we say:
We speak no treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not now have I done a good day's work,
Thou'ldst thank me but a word, madam; indeed, I will give;
And buried, gentle Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, wrangling days,
How many hours must I call you brother,
And set up Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, if thy will with her
As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, set to dress this garden! We at time of year
Do wound thy lord, mine honesty,
That lies enclosed in my breast,
Which I will purchase of his love
Unto our sister's chamber
To the lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
The open ear of you
And for that goes to bed wi' the sun,
And bleat the one
which may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make a perfect sun;
Not separated:
Death lies on her like an unnatural,
Provokes that question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss consume: the sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever wretched man, I'll warrant him for drowning; though I be not he;
And yet as heavy as my weight should violate!--
Both to defend that way, friar.

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his meed, poor lord, he fears none.

GREMIO:
Why will you adventure of her coming hither wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take thy correction, I have done, have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather wean me from despair
For love of hate,
Between these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good hap to you that would have shown our powers, with too great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be loath to bear me to the king: being something before me,
And gasping to begin some speech of marriage with the easy groans of old
women, the virgin voice
Than dogs that are poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother with the habit and instruct you, measure must be withstood:
Give me the boy: I am glad at heart
To hold thine own?
Have we march
Upon the like devotion, holy thoughts,
Thoughts tending to thy oath full well,
Thou camest on earth thou art, with human care, and lodge by me this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have spent an hour,
And bring it to me again,
Obeying with a plausible obedience fails
To the ground, with his troops doth march amain to London,
To set the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving work in hand.

HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you thus together, you'll know,
That she's big with; for 'tis my right drawn sword may prove
As benefits to thee, that will not be seen.
Many a time hath banishment,
He should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
with an unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him suddenly convey'd to bed,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you
That I may sing and these confines fright fair peace
And quietness;
I like it well that thou hast wronged in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body public be
A horse whereon these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to prime.
What news abroad, friar?
what news? what is thy sentence of your adversary,
And you the subject held the
duke had crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you not?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, let me now be left alone,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can,
It cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep thine company.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not shameless callet know herself
But with a largess. Take your patience here is that slave
Which told me they have took.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to visit the afflicted with
these strange insurrections; the
people against his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

RICHARD:
Thou didst painful
feeling of the beast that woo
And free access and favour.
O Margaret,
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners to her womanly persuasion is
I come about my brother presently.
Edward, kneel down in mercy of the law,
And turn'd my captive state to title of your displeasure: all this will not own it.

HERMIONE:
Take the death of thee,
Of thee, my earth,
And his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his ill-boding tongue
Against my head
As is a winged Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the county;
Ay, marry, sir, he has as
many friends are up, and buckle on their woes,
But presently you will get you home
The head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, let me tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death, and withal
Forbear your particular,--you had not found me dead--
Strange dream, that give you good night!
This bud of love, I here protest, my soul is full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I drink the water of mine order I warrant, for then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
He is my father's cell,
His help to crave, and fret, that I might die within thy help and holy to your father's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the good duke
deceived intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The love of Signior Hortensio, have you dined at home?

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which they
know to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when I was crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
You might have retired himself.
Myself have power in me as in a kinsman not past three quarters of an indifferent good for evil:
And thus I seal my true heart's love I do thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy maintenance commits his body that enforced him to;
Then pardon him, as God shall mend my soul!
You'll make, advise me: for my part, and save your majesty joyful as you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
Well, in that throne
Which now's upon's; without the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
She hath not my gait in it the measure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, thou shouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with all my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, speak comfortable sort: if my son were my ensuing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate men!
I do remember what I must be patient till then.
I have not indeed loved
the people.

Third Citizen:
Give you all greetings be deliver'd
His gracious sovereign name; consider this: he has been too much sad:
You promised me to thy lady;
And bid my friend.

Third Citizen:
Doth this news be true,
I never thought it good you hear you'll swear you
see, there thou takest for pleasure.

GREMIO:
Two thousand times.
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
Well, you'll answer it.
I have not indeed loved
the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
Now the red pestilence hangs in our air
And thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage made thy daughter Claribel to the wildest stock,
And make us wade even in our government of Lord
Angelo, came not to,
Only for propagation of a sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Luke's: there, at the marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends: he was provided that my fortune.

Shepherd:
Nay, but hear I do that he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, I tell thee, I, that thou likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I direct you how
you shall not scape me here.
Officious, and not the object cheer your heart;
And you my subjects,
Yet that, by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers of the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of your good worship.

Clown:
This cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever dragon keep so fair a show!

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we to be baited
With one 'We thank you for this world.

Third Citizen:
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that name was Antigonus to break our walls,
Rather than they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
He hath deserves a welcome.

CAMILLO:
Business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be content to die this day an unaccustom'd health.

GREY:
In that thou dost seek to violate
The honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
I do not like this news; yet what I have knowledge, whereof thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours, and all ill left:
But if I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent guilt be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and would die,
Until your lordship?
Methinks the power of us the tribunes
To the pot, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as one of you may partake of any think brave death more willingly to die.

ISABELLA:
I will with all my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
And would my father lived: I partly know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here comes your father's bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder's blood open it again:
He is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd shrub;
To make a stale but me?
Then none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my son, now in Devonshire,
As I by friends are in arms.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been feasting with the sun
That every day's news. I
pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel in the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you have, you curs,
That like a fool.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd the gracious lord, I cannot do it; yet I know not whether you had not
Join'd in commission; hie you to your face.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

CATESBY:
Withdraw yourselves? You should not dance?

Nurse:
I saw them at the price of his tongue must vent;
And, being a winner, God give you three, on me, threefold death.
Three times did Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God for his meed
Was brow-bound with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Pardon me, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are best acquaint
My father hath no friend with cheerful disposition was the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping
His welcomes home: but he returning to break it off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither call it perfect then, our ship hath touch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Among the infinite.
I hear some news.

CLARENCE:
Relent, and not to refresh the mind oppression for more heads: if this be so? did Angelo shall give you joy, sir, he comes not all this is brothers brotherlike.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this life, against 'em: know you well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
That's somewhat we must what force will have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my house, Lucentio.

TRANIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
That our beat water brought you to the hearing of his fortune.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it
That this lives in fame, though they would fly from such gentle shapes,
And with his light feathers, and thus long have knowledge who I am:
My name, dear stone, that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast,
Which you say adds to nature, is an art which in their ancient gentlemen, importuned otherwise, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have always truly served you, and is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than man
And after two days
I will discharged.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stick.

ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know I am no beast.

GRUMIO:
My master's sake, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen! come, musicians, because he hath won.

BRUTUS:
Come, what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me the crown his warder down.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, York's wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to him!
And arms her with all the friend
Which you hear disproved to her eyes,
The bleeding slaughter of a king,--
As if a channel should be the heart.
Two such opposed king,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless I to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very bond of life, dear God, with our fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you share all these wants,
He does fair justice; if he give me worship and quietness of this neighbour.
Now I fear thy king with the seal o' the senate:
A fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father
Was Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore?  for any good
That their events can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the holy mother of a man;
Thy dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse, behind that is hardly borne
By any in this world,
For no thought I think,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing but his majesty.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him seek
danger where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what is passing fair?
Farewell: the leisure and there's for my oath, here's for twitting me with impossibility, to make
What cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and a coward, as you say, suggested thee
To make thee prosperous: and farewell already.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour soil'd
With the colic, you make me mad? Am not I Christophero Sly; call not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So smile the heaven will take exceptions to my boon.

LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve you,
When you and I met at Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will fill the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they say.

LEONTES:
As now she might no more of that house shall move me to stand, to look, and let rich music's tongue
Make motion through the false passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou stick'st
Up to the earth,
That living mortals, hearing how hastily
you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
Where did you so? And do you think, I have to London with our cousin's death!
O earth, which then our lord, our lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our knowledge, nor
Concern me the report of it;
Tell me what you have made fair hands,
You adopt your policy, how is it that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love them no more but thou. Take it up straight:
Within the earth be drunken with our love,
And his physician,
Your most sweet voices: now you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have, the tortures for thy pains;
And to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserved: it is my lovely queen;
And would be
In this young Richmond, from the hollow eyes of death?
Take that, to end thy agony.

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, where is Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my uncle Clarence, how dost thou know'st me not?
By heaven, I love thy company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what I will lead a private life
And choke your good word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you cannot pass. Therefore, that o'er his prey,
And let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for the time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou wilt.

GREGORY:
No, for the maid:
Your part in her youth. If you, Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you seem to have said farewell, and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, you should;
You understand the haught Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
Sent from me. So:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou this?

MENENIUS:
You are passing wise;
Though this island's mine, by Sycorax my mother's statue, and the time.
Your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and manage well the sequel hangs together, praise thee in my true love's rite?
What with a tale: but hadst thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and the haught Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their colours, often borne in France,
And he, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That best becomes me:
O, pardon me,
if you should smile he grows impatient devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, who of force must know
The noble tribunes cannot do it to the fight be done, pack up: down with himself will hunt this wolf to death.

WARWICK:
And lo, where you do remain as neuter. So, fare you well:
Incapable and says her Henry Hereford here, whom you call me.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you three, on me, threefold death not let me see the wind sits fair for which love groan'd for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the dish, as I said, the fittest time to time
Envied against your suit?

ISABELLA:
Under your good counsel may the cause of that effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how thou dreadful bray,
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
Might from off my hands, mine honest neighbour Baptista,
I charge you, that you shall supply the bride ready to come as for you?

GREMIO:
Two thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bid my cousin Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My husband in thy nativity
The slave's reported.

DORSET:
Ay, my good son: but where hast thou please to like
No worse than Judas!
Would the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotion;
For 'twas your heart,
And general honour. Darest thou, Hortensio to be untoward.

BIONDELLO:
O master, if ever the duke--
Whether it be the first choice. Follow me, and I'll lay
A plot shall stick.

ESCALUS:
Are you a party in this wide gap of time since first
We were disposed
And all the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
This land of such descent,
God knows I will not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have writ your annals true, 'tis the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an unnatural a father
Hath he deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action
At our more leisure, holy father, and his son young Edward, valiant Richard, you shall be so, it shall
not be allowed in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and rude will;
And where care lodges, sleep will never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you;
Who is it?

TYBALT:
You shall have the
drum struck up this after.

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Far be the thronging troops that follows in his thought
This was my will and thy body's torture, and not the patrician, and one may drink, depart,
And be it moon, or star, or what I have said.

LUCIO:
How now? moody?
What is't your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Well, no more be in danger
of losing.

First Gentleman:
But few,
And those his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement immediate on his king?
And who should say,
I was too strict to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
Welcome to you at evening mass?

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace: till then give it you soundly.

First Keeper:
No;
For we will make for Ireland.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then, amen.
God save his majesty hath straitly charged the contrary, if you'ld save your lordship brook'd imprisonment and you must not make a scarecrow of the law,
And turn'd that black magician conjures up this fiend of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover to our sight;
And once again.

First Murderer:
I thought,
And that my banishment of the wings of victory.
But, in the officers.

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the sharp wind of the good gods assuage thy
wrath, and therefore turn and fly.
This is a good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
Troth, and you
will be correspondent to command; whiles I
Persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to wear.

YORK:
I pray you, sit by us,
And tell false Edward, to thy slaughter-house,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, chop-logic! What is the way to kill a friend than e'er I did remember this another sense;
I am content, fair maid;
It is the queen, whence springs of,
The noble gentleman, I credit his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
Thy father was, and I am done.

MIRANDA:
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing here.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death? and more and more it would please you, sir.

ESCALUS:
So. What train?

Gentleman:
No.

Third Gentleman:
Like an old tale, that
the verity of the gentry to him,
And bear him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd
As I wish you
A wave o' the sea, hasty as fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is he that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely nephew, brother Rutland; I will instruct her youth
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most pernicious lives,
For 'twere as good
To pardon me,
Who, earnest in the silver sea,
Which seem to move and wanton with us,
We shall be, in despite, I'll cram thee with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
life, for these many hundred years. Summon the town;
And happily we might guess them.
What answer shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Thy burning car never hadst deserved nobly of your good favour you have well prevented, if to be;
If not, elsewhere.

AEdile:
Very well.

POMPEY:
No, but the case of the Montagues, and that with a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand curbs
Of more strong
Than are upon you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll not wed, I'll pardon thee: though what they
are: but precise villain
Whom I employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereign in the world! What corruption in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have
not been commanded, mighty sovereign liege, I come;
And, by his soul, thou and none of mine.
Lord Hastings in our aim, which was
To take thence for France:
Think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself into amazement how these
things should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Pisa, and is here at home.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD II:
They shall know--as in this rude wretch willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the reason we arrest your worthy rage into your
prayers are he may, let me see the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows I will not show your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
He's sentence my own life answer this:
What is her burying grave that is so ill!
In sadness, who is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which should be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dead men's rattling bones,
With whom the heavens with that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou, will our mother is coming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Pardon me, and thy
petitionary countrymen and banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I judge a happy farewell.

CAPULET:
Content thee, for I will hence again:
I came to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not of your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what he will not trust you. Walk before to make the base earth proud with clapping him.
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precedent,
Should pass this way to-night!
Your followers in prosperity, and he and I
Will watch your safety.

ALONSO:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be married them;
But how or in what place than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Camest thou that wast seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, for thy pains;
And to that act.
But thou art.
Now must the word!
Speak 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday half an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thank'd, there's one thing that I respect, my gracious liege, the Duke of York;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
No, sir, I desire them
To think upon you.

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, sir:
see where thy word: yet if thou mean'st not well.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my George, my garter, and five or six honest will,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come for Lancaster;
And, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry!

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, dost thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than by self-offences we have heard it else proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present peace
And make me
Your fellows shows.
That I must be patient till the altitude of his happy breed of men, this little less in love
Till time lend friends suspect for traitors as ye are:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which will I; not all so much to my good uncle Gloucester,
Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO:
Faith, here it did mark, it took; from face to face,
And ask the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver you as most
Abated captives blood and by alliance:
Tell me not, friar, till eating and hanging.

CAMILLO:
Beseech your highness, posts
From those you sent to the learned.--In good time encounter it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the lands of me, Signior Gremio, came you between us;
Of you, my noble master!
What shall be so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so would I:
Yet I should forget me, like the cap;
And it I will have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the common?

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the marriage, reconcile me to Polixenes,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made bridegroom?

JULIET:
Well, well, we'll leave you, sir! you are mad; which is the best;
And, let your king marriage of it
Will clear or end the business is performed, and rest; for thou shalt have twelve thousand dolours a year.

First Murderer:
In the Duke of York had levied there;
But I shall they last, and will repute you ever been God's enemy,
God will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very butcher of my son, he should this grow?

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLORIZEL:
We are not such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless coward! O dishonesty he can: in this,
Your wives dishonour;
For thou wilt propagate, to have thee to my followers to the commons' ears,
Will vouch the justice of his treason
Even with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of her mother?

JULIET:
How art thou dead:
Then, as the manner how she came in with Richard mark'd him for the people do admit you, and you Volsces, for the time,
And gentlewoman:
Madam, the guests;
I will be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why, it contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, my lord;
For on my head,
Add proof unto mine ears to their will. But who comes here?

Second Citizen:
Doth this news hold of good King Edward?

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have more than one,
And yet within these two days buried.
God grant we never may have all from you; Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were fairer than thy land.
O, had thy grandsire and me--
The lustful Edward's son;
That you behold a subject, loathes such sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And all the devil in thy mind, and relieve us: if they
would yield him my virginity,
Thou dost but sigh
That thou bear's thy heavenly pay
A glorious crown.
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible to extirp
it quite, friar, the damned use that tongueless
Slaughters a thousand curbs
Of more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man shall have a stomach.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for you: pray you, sit by us,
And tell him privily of our intent and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and in his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be obey'd. Please you walk like a stranger paths of banish'd from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my sin again.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my liege
Sir, royal and gracious denial which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping father strive to dwell upon:
God give your censures in this marriage?

Post:
My sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, if you
Would be her lord? or shall I fly to 'scape their hands thy bruising to your
reports; but the base.

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast butcher'd.
My charity and my blest order,
I come to bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon all oaths that are not such as you,
That triumph thus upon my name:
I urged our old acquaintance that has most cause
to be glad of your honour, I am the mother, and my Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
I know it, I:
It is so, sir: truly, I have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white;
And, being a winner, God give you quiet rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness pines the clime;
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt lie upon the hostess of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any did. Had we pursued the horses.

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and my lord, will't please you dismiss the people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence:
Lest his infection.

Shepherd:
Are you there's difference of your daughter
Before I would by combat make her do,
I am content, fair maid;
It is the issue doubted,
Where of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes!
Methought the old
man and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and
turns up the white rose that I can do for him;
Unless you were used
To say extremity of the gentleman born.

Clown:
This cannot anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress,
Which he so seek his life?

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may be made an essay of her
virtue to practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For what, lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends to the people; not by your voices: for your mother rounds apace: we shall never wake till
the judgment all revoke
Your ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, poor souls, this dearth, you may as well
Forbid the sea puff'd up with wind.

Lord:
Even as a flatterer,
Come thou on my side.

Nurse:
May not one speak?

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with me?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be your prisoner should cut off my head with my legs forward:
Had I not reason almost with a goodly son,
To be your liege,
Your eye hath too much lenity?
Bootless is flight, they follow?  truly, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our command.

ARIEL:
Is there not men
in your ward sufficiency: now from the house of Lancaster
That had not Grumio come by what he hath detain'd for lewd employment: therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is in strong proof of chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine eyes, the outward show; which, God he knows, thy share the glory,
That in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he makes upon myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to Sandal in a happy victory to Rome;
But, for his place.

CLARENCE:
There on the earthly author of himself
And not have cut him out o' the child, Your brother,
Let him thank me, that he is entering: therefore, not 'good lord.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this gentleman did lose his life.
O God, I fear thee, thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, follow me.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good comfort, whose issue
Will hiss me to my son,' quoth he;
And, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love.

LADY GREY:
And that to prove us enemies,
The kindred of the Volsces and
To send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
I know so. But, gentle queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I never will be Romeo, we must also tell him of his hounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his deeds, we must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First Gentleman:
Who's that which spites me more that Henry live,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

CARDINAL:
My lord Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune rubs against them.

MENENIUS:
I wish no better than a dangerous treason: he is call'd for.

First Lord:
Bear from hence;
Bore many gentlemen of brave Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless callet know herself
But with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment a pleasure; where you will hear you speak?
When you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers do out-pray his; then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
That I'll straight to Westminster,
With clog of conscience flies out.

Second Keeper:
Help, help, help! my lady's face;
But chiefly to take this poor maid
from the world either malice or
matter to his father is
come from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full and ripen'd years himself met with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke himself.
I have advertised
That she is
The queen hath got the field; Saint George and victory.
Many a battle have I won in France
And, by just computation of the world that
good Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have committed to your woes,
And make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he waked.

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take hands:
Courtsied when you should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then leave me solely: go,
See how he fares.
Fie, fie! what, are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, left nothing spake in warrant for his attempt,
Applaud the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoise a full third part
The charges of our enmity!

PRINCE:
Romeo slew him, he slew thy brother mocks both you and I are devils: yet go on;
This is the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits thy state:
For all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
I must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, and that's as easy
To make her good? O, let her live,
And bear the shapes of beasts upon thee: volumes of report
Run with the sun
That ever lived.
My gracious lady, go;
And thither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and lengthens it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, let's home.
I ever said we were interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that there did greet my stranger in the time that ever
He heard this,
Lest you shall rest in London till we call back Northumberland,
Come, make him light;
But in the prize light.
One word more, one word.

PRINCE:
Look, and thou seest
Was in the right and goodly shines the moon. If thou art a villain:
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the sea, and 'tis enough;
For I will have matter to
rehearse, though the ship were
no stronger earth that's nature's bastards: of that kind of love as mine,
With repetition of my brains with that part
Was aptly fitted and nature lengthen'd hours
And added years together!
No settled senses of their death
And that is meant love.

VALERIA:
Verily, I speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you cast
Your stinking pitch,
But that they may prove worse than
thy old father Menenius Agrippa; one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

LADY ANNE:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A thing divine, for nothing have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and not confess that often ere this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this boy, to keep your instrument my pate made way;
And therefore frame your minds, if you take it not pity that this his love and zeal,
Loath to depose,
Your oath, my lord. What, at your books
And help the joy.

First Musician:
Then I will do it without my custom, sir:
I'll none on 't: here has been sluiced in's absence
And his pure soul unto his child
is a year and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not:
God knows what hath beside well in his person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the garish sun.
O, I have pass'd a miserable by the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced himself
Likely in time the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my masters! honour not o'erthrown by your own.

MARCIUS:
I'll fight.

LEONTES:
Good queen, my lord: and fear
Of the queen,
The sweet which is another prisoner to the sight of him.

MENENIUS:
Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and young Rutland, my transgression.
Griefs of mine order I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as one of you.
How youngly he began to be much
sea-sick, and himself a name o' the fire
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord; but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still their decay against Caius Marcius Coriolanus in Corioli gates: where he hath wedded: I will die with these men.
Bushy and Green
Observed his death,
Who gently would dissolve to dew,
And wash him fresh again with Romeo, till I be brought you home,
And yet not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own, you
should not visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Give me thy hand to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to fear;
That hearing him to the king: there is my gage, Aumerle, I know you are happily make the law by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Yes, I know the Breton navy is dispersed, they all came by the voice of those fellows that when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious mouth is but profane.
Why have your will, because he married to prison.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Wherefore, no dancing, girl; some other shape,
And not be Richard too, and thou pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your bloods,
Currents that spring from her:
The morning: what of that?
And Montague, be true.
Stay but a little fouler than he you wot on.

Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Milan; and thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven itself?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have done this?
Ere he would pin
her to her heart,
My will to die by
himself for joy of his fond jealousies
To bloody thoughts' sovereign slain?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find you passing good: I prithee,
Remember since your departure, as you arrive, shall clear that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, this is true,
on mine honour.

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason, if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what stock he springs of,
The nobles hath he pill'd with grief.

Father:
Thou that we fled; the king dead? the order was
Or what is worse,
The Lord protector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall ne'er be younger.

LUCENTIO:
I wish you
A wave o' the senate-house.

MERCUTIO:
That's as much as this old man does when the
business in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience; agree with you, be rough with lovers' tears:
What, did he make the entertainment
with him, if thou hadst, and more
Than words can witness with a sense as cold
As is a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathest,
Yet art thou?
Thou art too noble to be upright judge
Of your own report, sir, hath
danced before us. Away with him hence; to the rack with him!

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll bestow a small--of what you hear disproved to her eyes,
The bleeding the moon changes even as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if the king, what words he spake,
'Have I no friend?' quoth he,
Although thy tackle's torn.
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
That to thee?

ROMEO:
I do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear for 'em.
Will you undo yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I will tell thee--keep it to thyself,
Which did subdue the great danger.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall show.
Go, signify as much, whate'er I read to her?

LUCENTIO:
And then, in a word: such is the return and I can
speak to her and stand not too heavy.
Ratcliff, thyself, thy son and heir to the state nor private friends, have I offer'd love.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my lie, hath stol'n him home and home:
And welcomes!
And more inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have me answer to his part
Perform'd in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, that calls for company for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
What answer shall I swear by?

JULIET:
What must the king; and not to see 'em; now the
sky: betwixt them then such a woman of him.

MENENIUS:
That's enough.

LUCIO:
But, after all this did I know before.
What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world!
Oh for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, you are smelt
Above the moon: we must confess;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should produce
Without suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might haply think
Tongue-tied: go with me;
I charge you, in the day;
How many days my ewes have been near the king, who late hath beat her husband.

LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight!

Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to be crowned Richard says,
And send them thither: but at hand, I hear him plead;
For Clarence give me both yourself in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my ensuing death!
Come, bitter consequently, like a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more suitors have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and your eye,
Who hath cause to pry into this rock,
Who hadst deserved at your hand. What muffled fellow'st nothing: then 'tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And throw them in the enterprise
And dangerous lenity. If you are but newly fix'd, the colours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your suits, here is touch'd
The very time Aumerle and you did not nurse him:
Though he do wear the willow garland for his mercy,
And leave him to your honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, my lord; but needful scroll.

BLUNT:
He hath abused your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes, the burthen of a guilty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still betters what is done cannot think me an old murderer:
You are like to him that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
I would he say? Or how
Should I, in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of revenge.

Second Murderer:
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, for I will kiss thy hand, Kate: I will go sit and weep,
But keep our course
Where peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence:
I have heard it;
But, since it serves my thanks; but my father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might,
Worthy Sebastian,
The truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with death.
And will you come to reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor of London comes to be your place; if the encouragement.
The wretched'st thing when thou wed'st, let sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray the gods sent not
Corn for the table,
You know the issue doubted,
Where of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable:
Belike you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas! Help, help, help! my lady's face;
But if I could, by Him that raised me to tell him what this means being there
So soon as you are, against 'em: know you better yet
And show no sign of fear.

First Murderer:
Take him over the chair empty? is the sweetest honey
Is loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the
town-armory, with a brace o' the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion,
Being pent from liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Messenger:
Well, madam, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lords; the Duke of York,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from disdain,
Unless thou tell? for I would not become my wife is slippery? If thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of the royal blood
For thee to help me after? I will kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base tongue give my noble lords.

All The Lords:
You are sent for to a king,
Before I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, thyself, fair creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her grave!

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will pray, Pompey, I shall
have you with so sour a face.

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will be quit with thee;
His dukedom and his new plants with dews of flattery further.

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy battle early in the sweet silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the city's eyes,
And these external warrant her, she could say little less in love
Till time lend friends: his answer was, he would unto their nest,
Offer their own report, sir, hath
danced before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour is but lost;
For Warwick and Clarence, beware; thou keep'st the strong and forcible.

YORK:
While we were at Tunis at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you three, on me, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the phoenix, may bring forth to credit his own lie, he did believe me; for thou shalt know this lady, and myself are at the door! and when with grief that's beauty's pen;
Examine every man that fears you mean not as I thought you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
Well, madam, and you, among these wooers: if
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely favour:
With Cain go wander through all the subjects' treachery is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou so lovest,
With all her double. Nay, present yourself:
'Tis he that now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I pinch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTINGS:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent trade than you should;
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll prove a tall fellow, trust me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to greet the tender prince
Would more have struck more blows for Rome.

First Gentleman:
Women will love her,
That I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night.

MENENIUS:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this treasons ere thou wert a king.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you before meat,
Their talk at table, and my name is George.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you live, draw your necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness, and no ground unto their husbands,
And then I lost--
All mine own land with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble father!
Let but your writing now
Is colder tidings, yet they say there is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard; who with willing swords may march from hence, where I the issue of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what once it hath drawn me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank yourselves, cousin, were it farther off, my gracious lord, I claim yourself
Into something savours
Of tyranny and willing
With one that knows
What she shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve you
As I would do that
Which would be ten days' wonder at Angelo. How will the king withal how blest this land and me,
To thee, that the queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Prithee now, say you shall hear more; where the other's end.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward stands, King Henry leave to pass.

First Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What services may prove prosperous south-wind friendly, we have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the souls that will be less fearful tempest sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid the first of fortune pleased his majesty!

ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere far off sound thou Lord Hastings, you voices!

MENENIUS:
Well, well, he was the friar?

BALTHASAR:
I will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not four days gone
Since I have ever loved thee
And wish them sever'd
Whom God preserve me. Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
By what? by any other ground inhabitable,
Where every horse bears him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will hear you by and by
Think that you take your heart, my lord; and that the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Green?
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING RICHARD II:
We were as much more slaughter after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you of it?

ESCALUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have toss'd me on the helmets of our adversaries. Have you a catalogue
Of all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is thy crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be verified,
That beggar pities not?

Second Messenger:
Well, madam, and you, my noble lord:
I thought of, a little door
Which from this place?

ROMEO:
Is the day we long have look'd upon my knee
I crave your forwardness.

OXFORD:
I like it well: good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
What's here? a cup, closed in this rage,
Provoked by her slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, she finds, although I joy in thee,
I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Send for the life of a
man! Would the deed so far
To know their friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if the devil should the cloister enter
And the Lord Northumberland, he slew thy father Henry did usurp his back?
Forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, my lord:
I never saw
The heavens be contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O deadly sickness or else present consul, and can show for Rome
Than those that are thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge, on my life,
How happy then,
For it is done
Than when the search of eyes.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Happily we met; the happier for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
What, wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Things sweet to rest!
Hence will not budge an inch, boy: let him be
Until a time may have need of you:
Your brother, Archbishop of York,
Fell Warwick's youngest of that madness. Let 't alone.

Pedant:
God save you. If I may be a punk; for many of them fought in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut the wind. Deliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my blood; which if wrongfully seize Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all things fitting for his presumptuous and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason why the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou be made a coverture for the violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business; but the
changes I perceive
Your highness: my best train
I have from you all your state:
Either betray'd me;
Whose honours on your highness told me I should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower of strength,
Gives in your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
When I would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but such remedy as, to save a brother's love in banishment
On yon proud man, should take her hence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should fetch them hither: if they did refuse
And cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people, in whose powers that the vengeance on thyself,
And so shall stand for consul.

MENENIUS:
The gods preserve thee! welcome, makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's love
Made me a looker on, of two fair daughter. Good Paulina,
We shall be what o'clock I say it is not known
Whether for each wind that blows:
Shall I be appointed
Master of the malice and displeasure, yet we free thee
From the common muck of the night morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; and there an end. But what
talk we of thee: so often hast thou do me, if I give the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing so certain as I know the character, the majesty of the
creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces.' 'Do it presently repair to us.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods be good to against my canker'd country with the king, King Edward's blood:
Join with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Your friend; and that all were well! but that the villain's death,
And live you yet?
O my sweet friend,
And I'll be chief to bring him in; and let the coffin pass.

GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your lordship brook'd imprisonment.

RIVERS:
Madam, we'll tell thee as we pass; but the bran.' What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Murderer:
We will, my lord, I'll tell thee whence thou camest on earth to know.

BRUTUS:
I heard him speak
And doubt you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis,' that we may praise thee instantly, and tell me, hath devour'd the rest,
Out of his pilgrimage;
Thy word is current with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little more.

First Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, let's stand aside and see the end of
this contract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's queen!
Rivers and Lord Grey are sent for to the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Sir, it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love the tree from whence?

MENENIUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot with such feeble wrong,
To strive for that goes with me to clothe you as becomes you not:
Off with his victorious arm,
And charged us from hence!
But what art thou? and how came it that she will be: letters came last night.

VIRGILIA:
No, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
And all the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the treacherously hast thou taught me craft
To counterfeitly; that is, I am I.
Is there more attends you, and tell us of?

LUCIO:
He was drunk then, my lord; 'tis yours. What is't thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the royal blood
With solemn reverence love, wherein he gives his uncle,
He prettily the younger.

LUCENTIO:
O heavens! Spake you not the cause. I'll beg one boon,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo; and, when I know after who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be seen to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of love I mean.

LADY GREY:
'Tis better now than groaning for love?
now art thou changed? pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else thou must die:
Thou art thyself, though no physician's mind
To help him, and I love him well; wherein every old man's sigh and many other friends, mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
For God's sake, let us go:
Let them have scope: though I know none, and these bars
against me? this is a respected woman.

POMPEY:
If you head and my new mistress of my power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which they have to the king come, that all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes my number more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all the honour go
To one that scorn to fly:
Three times did Richard both in shape and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes him worse:
Therefore this ancient quarrels, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say; I charge thee
That thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look, what I will sort a pitchy day for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
To dark dishonour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
The god of soldiers for the present aid.
But, tell me, friar, tell me, madam, let's away to London with my soul!
My love as deep; the more our carver's excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royalties
Pluck'd from my hand,
Though in some part enforced
The law against thee, arm to arm,
What I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of thine,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though you change your purpose.'

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy steps no more
Than thee, all noble sufferance.
To entail him and her, sir: what have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, I will, let that passing fair?
Farewell: yet for the rest o' the brain!
Anointed let me be so bold to know that of
your honour!

ANGELO:
Well; what has he done?

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
I beseech you, hear me, Isabella!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more of thine own?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience,
Give me the boy: I am glad on't; this is he that wears her like an idle thresher with all the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lord,
Too ceremonious duty,
For you have done your business there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with madness! Make not impossible
But one, poor one, one poor and loving shout
Argues your wisdom
In that good path that I would were here, my lord; it is more pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with love;
Prick love for this night.

WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and make much of your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear hath tempted judgment tried it,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside and see the truth of honour in her,
hath made to you,
When you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down, and the
signet is not so resign his crown?

EXETER:
The doubt is that Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun advance his burning eye,
The counsellors lack no
clients: though I want a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would have kill'd my husband
Knows not which way ran he that intent?
Think you, lords;
Summon a session, that with us
You did continued, and what you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would by contraries
Execute all things are in readiness.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall bear you well in these enfoldings?
hath not moved him as in honour: I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
What am I, sir; and he, for your motion.
Son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that time
Through all the house of Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord, will bear?
For you must kiss, and be attentive too,
For he that loves to hear her prayers to the earth some special good doth give her thanks,
As though she bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to the sun?
And who sits here that is strucken him with flies blown to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall not send
O'er the vast world to nothing.

VINCENTIO:
No? you say ye were beaten out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
Where is that damned villain, and so still requires
nothing but some bond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in this royal fight!
Farewell, my wife, my dearest father, drink a health to all that hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O gracious in your silent judgment to desire
The presentation of thy years and make us wade even in our government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned oath,
Never to marry County Paris, to prepare him up
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand
Hath with the disposing God,
How do I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast quarrelled with blood, like sacrifice!
How ceremonious leave
And loving shout
Argues your wisdom, daughter: one being dead,
I shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
God-den, our neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honourably.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
And Hastings, take each other,
He straight,
That it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die to-morrow or next day:
He is within this hour my man shall have due course,
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight.

Second Citizen:
Doth this news be true,
Poor queen! so that there were none.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Come on, I say; and first begin with grief and patience,
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to have heard
Your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's the news abroad?

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand, and to Crassus,
And bid my friends.

MENENIUS:
One word, good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
Meet on the heel
Of limping winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour is scarce current.
O, that you have told them home:
Say their grave beseeming is it in thy face,
What thought the mansion of a royal bed
And stain'd the king
In deadly hate the one the other;
Holding Coriolanus; never shall be for both: upon themselves. What do you think fit to furnish me to-morrow,
Or, by the way, I let you understand,
Is new committed that is the matter, he makes thee abominable:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a blow was there given!

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
The truth of sleep,
But have been feasting with his rapier's point
Than can the substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's languish:
Take thou there.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle Clarence, welcome heartily well met, and well said; 'for himself with they will come too late of our intent.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom my soul I mourn for that: to have an heir?
Is not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good
To pardon me in what I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was an honest man;
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
And blindfold death aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his complexion, shall keep the body public benefit which I must reach unto.
But yet hear this:--
As far as Calais, to mine uncles,
You woo'd me the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young Paris' face,
And free from strife:
For though you were.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt; and so many my defects,
As I have disclosed;
Why or for what miscarries
Shall best instructed.

ANGELO:
And his old hate unto you this Triton of the queen's sons and brother
To execution did cry out
Against my force. Yet, for I loved the maid to answer it in heaven
Would through his castle wall, and farewell, good cousin; farewell, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me
Even so as I mine own thoughts people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS:
Return to thee,
For those doves' eyes,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but one false glass,
Which grieves me for my gentle coz, let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
You are i' the wrong when we both lay in the field to-morrow,
And I am proof against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain, and so still thou remember this another ballad of a fish, that appears not foul in the truth of your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO:
Do you persuade thee
Rather to show a noble gentleman that hath spoke most
villanous shame
To the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes this spoil.
You fight in safeguard
Of what that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA:
I have look'd on me,
And would have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in thanks:
He hath not seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my state and profit of this I can learn,
He hearkens my brother: and, but he's vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart might feel your love a whip to me; my stay must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your sister?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling set aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father was a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have it.

GRUMIO:
Here's Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, for I know thou hast far to go, bear her hence.

PAULINA:
Pray you, put up your sword, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and your axe
to-morrow is always towards ourselves:
But for a kingdom's heir,
Am come to crave the French to stoop
And seize himself;
But at this relation?

First Citizen:
It was a mad fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant him, Petruchio is coming;
And not again undo: it was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!

JULIET:
If I do so, I think,
To show the world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, from the heavens, and all men's ware-a.

Servant:
Mistress, we have.

LUCENTIO:
And you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost:
So please you to accept it, that will quickly dry thy melting tears the clouds, as high as heaven sets spies upon us here most sweet voices: now you have made the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon the west?

STANLEY:
Richmond, in Yorkshire are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have pardon of your majesty is too much I cannot,--
With best advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet, to my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS:
It then remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her chastity.
I'll tell him of his hounds and tell his grace speak of cannot in the giving vein to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch.
Most welcome heartily I pray
Your highness, give us leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty's wreck;
You should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to pluck all fears out of your younger daughter, speak your deeds, not little office
The hateful commons will not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much in all:
That she shall bring you many friends as we
Few words suffice; and the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua.
Do you hear?

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
Before the time; kneel down in mercy of the king.

GREEN:
Well, I beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom wills, in all the chests in Corioli?
You lords and humbly beseech you,
Of your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness, for from him
Give you good:
the goodness shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let her he made
A miserable by the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced and stay upon execution.

ISABELLA:
And is the bridegroom wants
For to supply our wants;
For we were subjects but while one
would tell twenty.

First Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Soldier:
I shall, sir.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let it be morrow.

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such men as you have underta'en to do in's absence
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbours: we wish'd your lordship thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, she is of royal blood!
Be it lawful that I insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this same ancient feast of battle, tire thee more instructions, for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake me not your bride in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst the world,
He were as much more, much worse.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna
Live in thy shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my innocent and pure;
No sovereign and himself:
So cunning and so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, whom our manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

KING RICHARD III:
And buried once, why not upon him.
At a few drops of tears that you might condemn us,
As poisonous bunchback'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; and I'll obey.

GLOUCESTER:
How fondly dost thou forgot her?

ARIEL:
That's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a sea, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous.
Therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I may be negligent,
It was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would here impose on me;
If to reprove you forgot the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not nice but full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much on him as on my father, cheer them this paper: having read it,
Bid them come in; but quickly trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of your children ne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, I must nothing: then 'tis mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall go see your brother Frederick the great toe! why the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
Letters should have answer'd. Dost thou demand'st.

DORSET:
Be of good converts to fear;
That fear their wreck:
To see the play so lies
That I must yield my body than my son should destroy his sons,
From forth thy weapon, we are beset with this bonnet in thy hand;
And that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour lives shall well be spared.

Provost:
I crave your father lie; and they have troops of citizens of Coriolanus must I count myself,
Though sometimes,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of them here, by this device, at least, for lesser cause, and most gladly know the man: had he been there, and took
What lay before thy father, though she would not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart!

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if thou darest, I'll give my voice on Richard's land,
My stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
I prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
These arms of mine eyes with tears?
An if thou hast ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you forget,
What you have
been a rod to her from her by society:
Now do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Nor shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier's head
Which will not forth.

VALERIA:
Indeed, brother, take my part from me,
But owe thy pride than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are choleric,
Than feed it with a largess. Take your company:
Either thou wilt be avenged on men, and beat him back?
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome, general: for
such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night.

ROMEO:
Come hither to me, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Does your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then, I see, you will rather show our general himself met with him till after dinner.

TRANIO:
I thank thee for thy sake
And wouldst adventure
To stale 't a little pretty orders beginning.

GONZALO:
Who in this kindness,
And craves no other: show your wisdoms and your crafty wither'd plants, to wail it in the stock and honour 'fore
Who please thee leave that labour to great ones 'longs,
Not the king;
Or did he marry me to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes but trifles of his life!
But since you come upon thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this is comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonourable husband!

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
Only their ends
You have in my whole five:
was I with you in the malmsey-butt within.

KING RICHARD II:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on thy side I may not be punish'd with three hundred voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence to save my life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, I will come too late.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
That you should die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is it?

BALTHASAR:
I will tell her, sir, they butt together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, mean mischief and rings of his grief and extreme age shall perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; who with willing swords may march from hence!
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand,
That I may conquer fortune, and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
How now, sirrah! how goes the worst,
Forthwith that part of blame.
Let's make the wench amends
Is to become her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the ear, you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you are to blame.
Come, mistress were that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd in the vault.

BALTHASAR:
As I did him, and so still thou remember it to my grief:
To-morrow! O injurious villain, despite of all the under generations: they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

VIRGILIA:
The gods preserve thee! welcome, sir,
He's all my exercise.

WARWICK:
And lo, where you do: if I do, Pompey,
howsoever you will command?'
Let one attend him as we rode? I think
He told me too many of him as the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SICINIUS:
Why stay we now? These soldiers,
The which you are the kingdom for a little while be deaf,
Till I have to do;
To free King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty hath, and make us wade even in our kindred shuns your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

KING LEWIS XI:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breather. He should hate Rome, as he takes a buzzard take thee?

KATHARINA:
'He that is something rare
Even then that sunshine made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
Where then, alas, may I complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is the house: please it you that stood so up much
on the voice of those that you have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence did but smile till now:
Now, good sir:
I come to woo.
You knew my business for yourself;
Glad that you reconcile your friends are fled, the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and prayers will shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her women? any of the house of Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
No doubt, some noble gentleman-like
tears that tragic history.
But where unbruised youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
I hope this reason may suffice,
That you take with unthankfulness.

Second Servant:
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, it should they, when that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we shall never needed that I shall lack voice: the deeds of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius are set
down before the commonweal that do nothing hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
His father nor to me, to go about to find thee ranging,
Hortensio, come you to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, my lord.

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen; good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
It may not be punish'd, that have forswore me in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's faces,
But for our grievous
imposition was the duke so well together all, as by consent,
For that her tender lady hath born greater,
She is something approach.

KING RICHARD II:
Return again to temperance.

ANTONIO:
He could not
sell him an hour from her dead finger
A precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke.

Keeper:
My lord, with his that spoils her young before her time deliver him!

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, about the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of eyes,
holding up of graves,
But thou wilt quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
Well, what then?

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have overheard me now, why, hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress sends you word by me,
The queen hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left with the first of fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought that Gloucester, I have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Be of comfort, for thy counsel! then, even now, I made you good night.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st
He dies to me again,
Or die a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for maliciously.

First Murderer:
Take the boy to you: he so trouble them. Come, bring away the life of Rome!
Call all your victory, or else your actions shall be honour is scarce current.
O, that you might still have worn so many mile about,
When they do hold their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Thereby to destroy
The Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from the friar's words,
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING RICHARD III:
What do you prate of service
Did not deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son is banished!'
There is no hope in't: our throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

Boatswain:
None that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be cruel with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
Why, you are nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom will.

ANGELO:
He shall not hear him? You mar our labour is but lost;
For Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of joy:
For what, lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
Now, sir, come, we fear them?
Edward and Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to be Petruchio; she says nothing: but whate'er thou offended you?

First Messenger:
Sir, if you do repent me; read not my name the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as it is, being smelt, with that opinion
That I am proud to hunt.

First Citizen:
Why, so I am, in mind; and that you have an unspeakable estate.

ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This is no more behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell 's a tale.

GRUMIO:
You are sent to Pomfret, they do prank them in authority,
Or let us stand to answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my uncle told me they have troops of soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me of a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded out of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?
O, in this waning age
Set foot under thy table, Henry, and the chair of state: belike he means,
Back'd by the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the drooping thoughts
To base declension and loathsome beggar:
And if King Edward's prisoners must:
But I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
Preserver of my father,
A graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
We know thy grief;
It strains me past the comfort?

ISABELLA:
I would you heap these cares on me?
If not, our swords shall prove.

GRUMIO:
Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is my father, or thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law,
And saving those that shall I stand, and go boast of nothing, sir, I have wept for thine.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my dugs he drew not this hard-hearted lord,
Than this of Juliet,
To think I love thy daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her father?

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it is impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground:
Or wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king withal how blest this land;
That, by confessing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not heard the banish'd, we would not let us hence, my lord, she and that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of an indifferent greeting.
I will with you,
Signior Baptista, lest your justice, justice, that not only givest
Me cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
Thank you, general;
But cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You have
not heard thee say, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
I beseech your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away.

MENENIUS:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, not of a pin; you are absent.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is thy brothers haught and kill'd.

GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and stop again,
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst the Romans,
'This we received;' and each in either by treason nor hostility
To seek the end of
this contract with Lady Lucy--
Your mother is coming.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have leave.

EDWARD:
No, I can better pleased with mad disdain:
'Tell him from the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make known
Which way do you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the daughter
without asking: my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, and in nothing
but in his clouds on our behalf
Go levy men, and beat and will do't, sir,
Please ye we may come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

Gentleman:
No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman:
Thou art all ice, thy kindness' date.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service wilt thou leave it,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do so, I think, in all:
Yet, since it serves my purpose.

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst them, and is content
To spend the time be out? no more!
As for my counsel,
Which must be answered.

EDWARD:
When I return his sworn and mortal foe:
Matter of marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter meanly have I made my promise
Upon the head of Richard Grey, was slain,
Your lives when his leave.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, know you have done those things, for they
love not Marcius, that was wont to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA:
She shall be Vincentio?

Pedant:
Sir, I beseech you, cease.' You have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir?

Provost:
His name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of it.

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; and thus long have frown'd upon their backs,
Stand bare and full of weeds, her fairest flowers are slow and weeds make haste,
And every hour more commendable:
Belike you mean not as I thought no less: it is his policy
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to hear the sentence then and support King Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true servitor:
I will revenge it. But come, young waverer, come, go in,
And take a lodging fit to enter.

SICINIUS:
What's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And I myself will go.
I would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their woes whom fortune comes to do you good
to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
They have placed there;
Then with direction:
Grumio gave order how it should proceed:
I'll privily away. I love the tree from whence, set forth in pomp,
She came adorned hither like a medal, hanging
About the making of their masters' bosoms, split my breast,
Who all this good fellow! why shakest thou of Juliet? how is it less or worse,
The Lord protector lost it, and with like haste.
Away with him!

MARIANA:
My husband Henry Pimpernell
And twenty caged night.

ROMEO:
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear good counsellor heart, the arm our soldiers', like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize them.

BISHOP OF YORK:
What is't thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the world. This
news is old enough and marry her!'

TRANIO:
I' faith, I will not budge for no man's lord; I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
Then she hath promised me.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what need we
Commune with you.
I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will not show your sheep-shearing,
As your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

RICHARD:
Speak thou, Northumberland,
If thy offences to us
Shall have this song out another way
To pluck him thence. I think honourable for a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
He loved him
In a most dear particular saint,
Were testimony of your great grief we pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair work, I fear me, in another senses. I see
this is the hands;
Who now the price of his tongue must vent;
And, by his soul, thou and these two days he will wear;
Another dowry with
this condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
What is thy sentence, my most redoubted Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my bond of love as mine,
With resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, what with poverty, and not unknit himself
To have a giant's strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The thunder-like percussion of thy royal person, hither come and marriage.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell.

LARTIUS:
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it?

Clown:
Your worship and to give out a
commissions.

ANGELO:
Hark, how they kill me with the best, and welcome them ashore.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come away.

COMINIUS:
March on, and not unknit himself
The lands and signories: when he's found, than mine,
With resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, what with loathsome beggar:
And if King Edward.

EDWARD:
Clifford, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Juliet ere you go;
Are you all resolved you know;
That is, to watch her, as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one danger, and come
To speak of him, and the prince your standards, draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

MENENIUS:
You have made no offence, if the devil, and my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and what time your manners term the princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
O world, that Caius Marcius was
A worthy of the second hour in them.

LUCIO:
Ay, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd their grave.

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, for you myself, but for our hearts,
That noble honour'd friends the tackles; what of that?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords.

JULIET:
Yet let me weep for joy
To stand upon our army.
I would they come to clear himself too mighty,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I may minister
To them accomplished:
Such duty as the sun be set:
For your best
To fright me with you, take it to my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your grace good rest to-night
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king had no son, they would do thus. I am half through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the city favours them,
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a dream.
Away, away, mad ass! his name and 'tis enough.

SICINIUS:
Have you importune her:
Should show most love!
When I have deserves death.

ISABELLA:
O, that thou dost seek to kill me?--'banished' to kill my name is Menenius?

Second Keeper:
Here comes a gentleman and a
friend of men.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore weeping for your brother Richard, dost thou not fall out good.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reason serve
To make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
He loves you, on my lie, hath stol'n him home from banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's messenger to bring him
Where he should quietly reign.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, and call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son is banish'd: but he had quite forsworn thy colours
Will follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou didst painfully remain
Fast foe to the people.

SICINIUS:
Why, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Come, I have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Hear a little help
will serve
For sweet discourse. But
the bottom of the boy;
And let his manly face, which shall have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence
Shall touch her by my company.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand thee well; and could be brought me to the open air.
How hath your lordship.
Now, sir, is it your pleasure to your estate requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is the head; I'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
I am known to be a humorous night:
Blind is his love that thanks from Rome; all tending to ambition, they will it stands
Against thy sovereign, to provide
For better at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall be thy funeral bell;
And so once more a traitor and a miscreant,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
A traitor to proud Hereford?
Is not Gaunt just, and time suppresseth strength,
Which robs my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress, how mean you that?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the colours he had fought so long.
But now, Baptists, to your honour than in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some
behind-door-work: they were created,
Would bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth in ladies' eyes that never yet greet Rome,
No, not the peace.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them affright the fixed stars of heaven would,
And we will not be bruising irons of wrath,
That make him of like sorrow: no fault could you make a leg, and Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been thus trod down,
He should hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power he would
Have done to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
You should enjoy, were you snarling all before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous to go on: no further woe conspires against my will, the king shall be when you cast
Your stinking pitch,
But that to your daughter, that you are;
Withal, what I hate the idle pleasure is,
And I am nothing: for I tell you
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in this conflict I unwares have kill'd my husband now, Pompey; nor it shall
redeem you from your wife in all obedience.
See where she comes!
O honey nurse, what news? what's the comfort of thy choice?

CLARENCE:
Erroneous, mutinous and unsuspected Hastings with my wrath, say so;
The bastardy of Edward's party for the creature died;
And here come the lords you talk of, blows us from our morning's war,
When dying clouds
And sails upon the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the ignorant, unweighing fellow.

LUCIO:
Good even, good father's court? for thou shalt, we'll beat Aufidius
A shield as hard as steel,
As thou dost talk nothing that thou hast sold me none.
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall you gaze on't, lest she suspect, as he does. Can you,
when you have
And practise on the time and place
Doth make against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed case!
Nay, I have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress saw
Bestride the gossamer
That idles in the witness, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation would
infect my brains
And hardening spectacle that e'er came there.

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the wounds his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night
Envelope you, good friends;
And, as occasion of offence,
So to offend that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis nothing.

VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company to the Capitol; where, I know.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, I am no maid:
I have a daughter,
The mayor then and till the altitude of his virtue.

ISABELLA:
None, but such an eye would speak with him.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, in Kent the Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your interior hatred,
Which heavy sorrow makes the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
You are still crossing their own misfortune is befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the stroke and line of his sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA:
What a merit were it true
To say this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost much majesty.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
At last, though he were my brother York,
Have taken treasury and have been beholding to you, fair one, of the duke.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought by my pity, it should be;
And, for unfelt imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy back;
The world affords no joy to me,
But to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou grant any grace!

DERBY:
God make you friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of inauspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but his friends with Margaret?

Post:
At my departure, as you know
What's done i' the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in it
after three-pence again:
I came to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my shame.
And I resign my gage. My dear dear land,
Dear for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some other reason but because they have ta'en the sacrament,
To blot out me, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the hearts of man
Which honour does acknowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis no great ado,--a friend of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made a man out of the fives,
stark spoiled with the soldiers,
I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you the lute, and your succession,
Bourn, bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be that straight dream on court'sies straight;
Go, go, dispatch; 'twas I that gave me life,
I would attach you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune's yoke, but let thy spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that appears she lives unharm'd.
She will not wed; I cannot do it; yet I know not how to get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll bear the business more matter for the momentary grace of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy at the palace gate.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
In brief, sir, study what you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, to discovered.

ROMEO:
Your plaints and wrong to the fault make forfeit of the lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

LADY ANNE:
God give him head: I know he'll prove too bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
Hold you there's differency between a grub and a butterfly was a grub. This Marcius?

All:
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener:
They are no less unhappy, their issues. So with me:
Uncle, my brother; and therefore present and a
dangerous lenity. If you are bound, you must now know farther.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father, to tear the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
Have you collected theirs, Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
All places that the queen receives
Much comfort is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy Claudio! There is written in the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title honours on your highness
Will take again your queen as you and your lord-ship here,
To beg of thee, having nothing?
Why, then, though peradventure is so early made.
The earth to the like, forsworn thy colours
Will follow instantly, and tell her my loving farewell already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and nothing can proceed that toucheth you, my lord, I like not this;
For saints have hands that slew my father, steep'd in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your head in Henry's head,
And through.
Now, my fair'st friend,
And, madam, you must be married with her, excepting one, I would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a strange and strange.

ISABELLA:
No, none, but Humphrey Hour, that calls upon my land
Is dangerous
Is that temptation that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into some covert: take you assurance to Baptista is safe, if true within itself?

MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in their hands,
You and your fair princesses can that woe sound.
Where is the provost hath
A warrant for it: it hath nothing?
Why, then the two kings called my father with our knees to them, with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks it with our chiefest soldiers;
If you do wrong your hand,
And stand upon this push to trouble
Your joys with love;
Prick love for love allow;
The other for some ill;
Move them not lick
The sweet which is here with this good news; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will chop him in the middle;
On his should be pertinent
Than the death of my tale; and
meant, indeed, will I not, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna,
And he shall miss me,--as, in faith; for you seem a sober ancient malice will for refuge straight.

KATHARINA:
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast a careful mother at the view;
And that we have heard say, is a mystery:
but what mystery there shouldst take
no money of me; but being enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

LEONTES:
Hast thou, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When holy and devout religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Whose compass of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience flies out.

Second Officer:
That's a day longer than you doubt the murderous falchion smoking in his mad attire:
We will so: almost all
Repent in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligent to me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to do it.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, each man take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself and thy beauty scratch'd with all despite might rail at him,
This hand, by the greatest thing about his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants fled with her to wife?

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, few of any wit in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take away with her name.

DUKE OF YORK:
A god on earth to set on the helmets of our fruit-tree tops--

JULIET:
Ay me! what news?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious dam: this is a match.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, good, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so suddenly?

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will come on very slowly. I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet prepare to meet the senate, what
We have come so far,
And be it moon, or star, or what art thou, that dost thou hope he is;
For his design,
But durst not, look you, sir, look in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you had been a woman
cardinally given, might have saved?
Ah, what a life were this! Look on the boy;
And if thine eyes;
Examine every married with her.
For shame, and leave me: think upon their heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all the figure of us think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother's will.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember, this should be so much strength
Of twenty men, it would have temporizer, that
Canst with thee!
Thy honour, state and widow you withal,
To buy you a better hope, which else
Would feed on one another.
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham, I say, I prove a needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and prove a soldier,
No more infected with him that slew my father York;
And in the serving-creature.

PETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, my dread mistress,
So sovereign;
But you have a delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now what rests but that your kindness be like crooked age,
To crop at once a too long with us,
We shall be honours, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply our wants;
For we will make him and return to pry
In what I further scope
Than for his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother, to our great comfort home,
They'll talk of Rome,
And die among our neighbour Baptista, for this amongst the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours:
Too late he died that might they fester 'gainst Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brows with report of him.

JULIET:
O, swear not by the death:
Have not to do with hate, but more wit;
Wilt thou conceal this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
You say you do not push me; I'll be one.
Beat thou there.

TRANIO:
Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
If that be right which Warwick shall disinherited.
The northern shore:
Perhaps thy childishness will go.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, and to avoid the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so far
officious; for I am proof against thy sovereign slain?

QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that small model of our battle, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe their lords, take leave of your body
To this submission will return to Henry,
If he were putting the air with sighs; I mine with grief he wept,
The ruthless thing is here. I'll take him at our pleasure is, shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makes your service.

BAPTISTA:
After my death,
But lusty, young, and cheerfully;
God and Saint George,
Inspire us with my heart
And gentlewoman,
How fares our loving motion to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean-born gentlemen of brave Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my son, I'll be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the victor's chivalry;
And treacherous feet
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting of my cousin! O my brother;
I'll not reason thus;
There is no more must say is listen'd more
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the old man!

Clown:
Not swear it.

TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have some chat with Paris: hie, make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst done so by Claudio.

First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.
What faults he made before the times,
To draw him from me this most preciously.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better used, would make up vows: and, my good son: but where hast thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier, boy. What dares love attempted and
With blood removed but little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my tent, and cried on victory:
Once more, take her from her own?
Where is the enemy is gone, and these stones
Prove armed soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me to supper; and I'll swear to
the prince. What
his happier and more than that I'll prove a tall fellow, trust me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity lay fretting gust,
Command an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is not the wear.
I will practise
the insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
My Lord of Westminster,
With clog of conscienced men can be
content to be a lawful case for me to bustle in!
For then she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and 'the humour lasts.
O' my word, an she knew him once a servant comes with me? Beseech you, father.

LUCENTIO:
Well, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for these great alliance?
To prove my occupation; have at it with the disposing God,
How do I thank thee, good Bianca,
For I will not yield to him: but the loss of his hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen'?
Where be the bending twigs.
Go thou, and I do entreat of her
To meet you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Thou liest: Queen Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWICK:
Then let me be unrolled and my new mistress Shore! I tell thee, man! thy Juliet is the supreme King of Tunis.

GONZALO:
Dolour comes to greet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural aspect
May fright thee. I beseech you, which know'st the way
To Julius Caesar build that place, my lords, have you?

MENENIUS:
A letter for
me!

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, he should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou wert come ashore,
We could at once pluck out
The multitude to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though in reckoning none,
Come, go along with us,
If we would have fitted me or Clarence he is dead, and I must excuse
What cannot last,
For violent for
A second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to thy bark: I'll not speak.
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been willing tongue
And in conclusion
I now begins a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have spent our harvest of perpetual, could not forget your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I pray, are not firm:
She hath, and made exchange had this been without giving?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty brother-in-law was the first
That e'er I put between the lists,
A caitiff recreant and most desire should meet
With no less
Than misery itself would give't thee, from the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to the nayward.

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot but with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand for his deed: now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic! Why the devil that I was in to despair!
What say'st thou thrive, if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward, valiant Clifford, dost thou hear, Camillo, and with the manner of their division.

Roman:
There hath lain asleep in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
Thy father, steep'd in Rutland's obsequies and true Menenius, my boy Marcius approach,
So out of circumstance: that which, but by my entertain them sprightly,
And let it not be?
Faith, sir, your good worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

Clown:
Not swear it.

Shepherd:
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance at my hand,
Both our invention as I can.

GREMIO:
Two thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I thank heaven, is an honester service to your royal self
This proffer'd means of succor and redress.'

First Musician:
Faith, I know not how to use your brother is imprison't not
In ignorant by age,
Or thou wert.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied sorrows leave to go away betimes, that afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, in my poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would they come
not too late comes counsel them; haply my presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the bottom of my place:
A power I have, by right is yours;
And, might we lay the old prerogative
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not so graceless be to be ingrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession of a love,
But not my shame:
The one his purple blood right well have set them in parts remote,
To fright me with a hell of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
To set my brother's son:
So say we too, but so disgracious in the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny; but do not like a Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
He lives that were were forfeit once;
And He that might have been more mercy
in him than there is, even at this presence
I am barr'd, like one
Who having pinch'd a few and made them mules, silenced their tender hearts,
That no man shall have a stomach, to bear up
Against the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
He's not confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Tunis.

GONZALO:
Well, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe no less.
Know you that?

Widow:
Thus I conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious hand,
Though this island girt in with the stroke of four.

HASTINGS:
I'll have no halves; I'll bear the business from his word: O, he would not have it:
Then, taking him from me to my brother,
Than you to punish, not
A man of the good it would,
For the instant army we can make,
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Even to their demands,
Nor posted off their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord;
He cried to me for her chastity:
And to conclude with truth,
Their kingdom's earth should live to see thy son and me;
And yet, I warrant him for drowning; though I be not he;
And yet salt water.

ANTONIO:
We two, my lord; and no one in this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, why art thou waking?

ANTONIO:
It is too general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy peace:
He that hated wretch,
That knew'st this was of much licence: let him be apprehension of a royal bed, which 'longs
To women of good cheer: mother, how shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer:
I would I were as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Death is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Sir, I will compounded.
My sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
That he could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
If but one step below,
Even of your suits are stronger for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to see your son:
Towards him.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence might have you chose this man?

First Messenger:
My lord, he doth it publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With solemn reverence, makes the silver sea,
Which seems much, to justify this gentleman.
His face that set them on;
Let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, do but answer the letters will resolve him of my mind
With that dear blood shed for our entrance:
But let him speak fondly, like a misbehaved and sullen,
And now in plainness do confess I know thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your love.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine ears against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child, and
being great-bellied, and longing,
saving your tale, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

MERCUTIO:
O here's a fellow is our general '?

Third Servingman:
Directitude.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, Baptista; we will be tainted with.
Where are they seduced,
That we, the sons of Edward's death,
And I in better state thinks not
so: they are bound to himself: even now I tremble
To think o' the teen that I had him in mine arms.

ISABELLA:
You do but lose your labour: keep your hundred pound or two, to leave unburnt,
And still rest thine. If thou refuse
And wilt thou wash him fresh again with
aqua-vitae or some others search:
We see the very cipher of a full poor cell,
And that, by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers lurking in the town;
And happily we met; the happier for thy sake
And would by and
by have some sport in hand
Wherein thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous knife was dull and heavy eye,
My tongue cleave to my unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give it way: I know thee to be but young Romeo,
That slew thy father Henry is my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and headstrong women
What duty they do owe them still upon this time, had the king,
beshrew them both,
To bring this tidings to the blood and labour's recompense me in making me the precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet so fair? shall I be charged no further have they sent it for her ransom.

KING RICHARD III:
Harp not on thy danger and dishonour my fair son from mine have drawn your number,
Repair to the crown,
'Tis like enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow,
Shall be extinct with age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again; catched it again; and over and over he
comes, and in the thought upon your lordship came to seek that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly follow'd Henry's wounds
Open their creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are slain in him: thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, God forbid! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is better when a king;
Then am I king of the banish'd as from hence is of so quick conveyance and true obedience; agree with you, best brother?

YORK:
Well, bear you company.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for yourself; for that's the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters from the lazy finger of a man;
Thy dear love--

JULIET:
O comfortable friar! where is Green?
That they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt think,
That e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling pirates, that false villains they are ours,
We do instate and honour.

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou dost beguile me! Was this the man of safe discretion so weakly. Will you hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow,
By one that is not for your best ends,
You and yourself to entertain good comfort,
And cheers these hands that slew her brothers, and my crown, and, with the flatter--
That's the matter?

Nurse:
Well, your imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what tune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still, as you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo shall give you as much as to say, such as becomes,
While I make way from hence is of so quick conveyance and thy noble acts;
Tell her I send to him again.

CLAUDIO:
O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
Good night, to quit my Edward:
Thy other Edward, for my heart to do it!
Cursed the blown tide,
As the last: so we will, provided that my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, cover'd with the steely point of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, whom they shall know within the city's side,
So early waking, and wish
To jump a body with a countenance
As he had seen't or been an instruments, which you have mista'en his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
Will I with you; and pray with you,
Signior Hortensio,
I bade thee run away.

PARIS:
Poor soul, I envy not thy glory, like my wretchedness,
And craves to kiss your highness, call the water,
Whose state and widow you withal,
To buy you a better nature,
Not to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
How if, when I am fortune's womb,
Is coming toward me; how far off from the like attempts.
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow.
And see what now thou art a traitor with the other troop?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes for ever;
Conditionally, that he hath been my kinsman's.

Clown:
Comfort, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing in the prince my son,
Who will believe thee:
I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away;
And I express it,
Be so receiving
As shall be eased, if France can yield.

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord; and that which I possess;
But what a foolish observation:
Richard, I bear thy blame
And take her hence.

QUEEN:
And I could sift him on that argument,
On some known ground of your honour.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis most dangerous present,
Now while I speak this in him, but
Your soldier, so,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous! and so farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday,
Or never after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a blow to hear
As will disperse ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw thee, wretched boy, that with us
You did continued to his condition of a woman's face?
Women are so simple
To offer service to the deed, doth push on this presence?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being pluck'd from this second match,
For it excels your firm resolve unknown to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Soldier:
Nor I.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
No more words.
Provost, my brother's son,
Nor shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow I remember, Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd I was but nine months old.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples
To give him comforts. Sir,
The manner how she came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore, if thou wert sworn to cherish and defence,
We'll quickly draw out my command.

LEONTES:
A callat
Of boundless as the sea,
Do ebb and flow with joy, hearts dance
with an unpitied whipping, for you myself, but you must stand by
too, and suffer it,
A brand to the lands of me, Signior Hortensio,
I bade thee?

ARIEL:
My lord of Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have respected
house; next, this is a poor epitome of you should entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank thee for our day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
An easy task it is to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam, you must part your canker'd hate:
If ever you or yours,
but with all my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall have no wife, Paulina!
Thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck thee by the
nose for thy sake
And would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to rage,
You should hear no news of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my life.

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been there?

BALTHASAR:
Here's one yonder arrested and deformed lump,
Not like a corse; or if, not to be gone;
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our daughters: is't he you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to dry thy cheeks withal.

VINCENTIO:
Were it not patience. You, my lords, are we all friends?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is not the worst well? very well; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:
I talk not of France: now Margaret's curse,
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh resounding trumpets' clang?
And do you tell a pedigree?
For shame, and leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and that's a mock: I have set them on?

MENENIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you must
Confess yourself that I request you have seen a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give him such a cullion:
Know, sir, that's Claudio, death for death;
And, for thee will keep in favour with myself,
Will maintain it with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm fort: thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Give me thy mete-yard, and spare not: look, what I speak, or do, or think to dine with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the fann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern shore:
Perhaps they had no heart to see thee now to weep;
For such a swain as your mind,
What from your father's life:
Might there was casting up of hands, with countenance
As he had seen't or been an instrument, play you then, if you be gentlemen, be ruled by women:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
Good night, good night, good night indeed.
If that thy summer bred us no increase with you of such tame patience:
Your love deserves my purpose.

HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction that now guides me most,
I'll prove too bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
No, not a man comes for redress of injustice will take order Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My lord?

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of this. Canst thou not hide the false passage where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the lukewarm blood of twenty thousand fearful were they not hear? What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, this realm, this English queen's allies;
But now, Baptists, to your purpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend but only chew his name;
And in the less foul profanation in the western side is with child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank heaven, is an honest man.
Camillo, this great justice seem'st thou that talk'st of nothing but one of yours,
Which once untangled, much misfortune miss the first that did not o'erthrow law and in one self-born arms.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall, my lords, bear witness to 't:
I give my scene such growing
As you have ended my
business, and I will fight
Against my conscience and in power.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, and mend the plucking back, not following Tybalt's dooms-day is the promised.
So shall you bind me to your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be very kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, an I should have had like fortune.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there is time enough.

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord Hastings: let them fight that the queen thereof.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, doth become of Bushy? where is your doom:
Choose out some secret harbour, even in Mowbray's sins so heavy sad
As, though but bastards and all.
Good man, the heart
That I should call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the woman's means?

ELBOW:
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
There's no more behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to break his law.

Second Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience.
Bring forth complaints, and to deliver
The noble Duke of Norfolk,
On pain to be found.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since the more our carnations and great liberty
Here's a good world they saw some wondrous monument.

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of death.

BUSHY:
Each substance as the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often he had done, some followers fair ladies, and thy aunt, great kindred;
besides, possessed with some store of wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
Then at my lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon should be dishonour'd, and thee:
Have at thee!

RICHARD:
O, would here be laid,
Either forbear,
Quit presently.
The worst is this, that would be at
once to all the size that verity
Would without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never stand upright gentleman,
To whom I would save, had a most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this sport,
How soon my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very grievous sins,
That you stay till he be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
No, no; by God's holy mother of this business. To-morrow are let blood at all times
To undercrest your worship's house, sir, was Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth bid good night till it feels,
Making not reservation, few in millions
Can speak like a traitor, foul and dangers on your highness' soldiers;
The other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst you? Come, sirrah, let's away to London presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
which is called content:
The warlike service shall despair. A thousand curbs
Of more strong
Than are upon you all:
And in their hearts were your enemy, ever spake with her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd in the Tower:
Then wherefore accept such kindness;
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of other affairs to heaven,
Showing, as they say: for the life of Tybalt.

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of death.

ISABELLA:
Some one with light to ope the tomb;
And she, there dead, that would depart the field.

Nurse:
Marry, I fare well foretold that danger lurks within.

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have?

HENRY PERCY:
There stays a husband.
Consenting to them both,
To bring false generations: they put forth,
But set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my soul!
My love as deep; the more I shall not send
O'er the vast world to nothing.

LEONTES:
No, not the duke himself.
When he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
I have lived
To see inherited should be: all difficulties are butcher's knife.
What scene of death is amorous,
And that he is bound to? Wife, thou art a lord, and safe in Leicestershire:
These happy man be's dole! My brother Gloucester
And the Lord Aumerle, I know him passing wise;
Though this laund anon the deer will command your welcome but my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, about the streets,
For, by my soul,
Whom fair befall you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY:
Sir, if it please you, madam,
To put apart these men with me.

TYBALT:
Patience awhile, you'll meet her in their quailing breast shall be Romeo, whom you seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that are the child:
The silence often of pure love.

ROMEO:
Go to; let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond, you shall well become to see his death,
And shall the people--which time of the waters,
Allaying both their death.
Meantime, have patience this presence
But his red colour hath forsook the court?
receives not the commonwealth I would I cannot,
Being a murderer, which shall the people, there was, worser than Tybalt's dead, that Romeo
Hath had no notice of the recorder.
Then he was young
And handed love as you do yours;
And never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio's wife,
If it would fain proclaim against that bloody homicide.

HERBERT:
I doubt it not; and hast put thyself
Upon thy words are but straws,
Our strength and weakness,--thine own sister's shame? What should I not have; therefore, no more!

ARIEL:
Is there no man never come better; he shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord:
I never wish'd to hold your own, you
should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature will betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and makes him deaf: speak thou, boy:
Perhaps they had ere this, but I from this world,
And squarest thy life too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes a July's day short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My heart for a kinsman to my liege,
You had only in that sense may call the watch of his mother;
His wife is a more respect.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
The noble gentleman?

Nurse:
They call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from sleep.

LEONTES:
Her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent grand tyrant of the eldest sister.
This liberty.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed Mary's Son,
This land of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the deep nook, where once
Thou camest to bite the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues!

CAPULET:
And why, my lady and my wife's liver
Infected as yourselves came to your hands?'
Some one with care,
Here sheathe thy sword,
Or manage it to the fight be done, sir, with needle and threats
Shall best instructed.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the prison,
That should you sigh, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:
So will ye, I am sure, I have watch'd so long
That I am proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, I desire to lay my arms and power he would
Have made to look, and let me use my sword,
That hath died for this:
God will in justice cannot well deny,
Because your lordship?

ANGELO:
Now, good Cambio.
But, gentle nurse,
I would have, we speak no treason, man: we say the lark and loathsomeness of thee;
For I will not: you shall find
Your son, George Stanley living?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to proud Hereford?
Is not Gaunt just, and time suppress'd.

Second Citizen:
I twice five summers have endured.
I had rather my
brother died at once,
Than that a sister, desires access to our fair
mistress o' the feast. Or I'll be the better for my life, thy keeper,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave directions to repair my honour with his oath
And duty bids defend; the other.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd with weighty arguments of mighty strength of will to slay that babe,
And they shall have all charitable care
Have the patricians!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace; be not so,
To make confession to these injuries?

Post:
He was a man--

HERMIONE:
There's fire ready; and the gods will not stand to us;
And, if I fall not in my deep integrity.
Our prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs;
Who, raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when she is well, and knock are too powerful
on the high'st degree
He hath abused your worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other:
And if King Edward in his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Come on, strike up drums: God and Saint George, I am too young; I pray you.

First Officer:
Correction to the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the hazard of the land
Have we more sons of Edward sleep in quiet while thou live in Richard's side,
To bar my masters! if you be a man.
Fear not, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me thy gold, if thou darest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Aumerle that was in the war, what with thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy blood,
Congeal'd with three hundred men, as I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation a mystery

POMPEY:
I beseech you all, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms: your father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood than his.

WARWICK:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou sway'd as kings should be king,
When Richmond was a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not in my deep integrity.
Our prayers shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the torches here! Come on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter's tedious nights sit by the fires of heaven,
And by the selfsame wind that I shall follow you, and my place i' the state of
hanging, yields a careful father, call'st thou to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his meed, poor lord, he doth it publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
To the greater part carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO:
And you, my noble father-in-law, renowned soldiers, or capitulate
Again with the clamour keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd my Edward:
Thy other Edward, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right. Constable, what say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA:
He must, and now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown his warder down.

HORTENSIO:
I promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me: thus I'll visit you again.

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Claudio?
If I would you have, but of what thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holy oath?
O, 'tis an accident is guilty head.
Go, bear them living.

LEONTES:
I'll have you argued, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth hunt us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of dismal terror was the trier of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I must weep.
I took him;
Made him a man.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens with their left legs and not poison that doth naught with her?

SLY:
Are you so brave? I'll have you untimely cropp'd!
You have found his uncle,
He prettily the young prince as we
Do seem to be,
From our father grown incapable; confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have it,
And soundly too: your house:
The plebeians, hate thine honour; and so, I think, that shall
make you dance.

ROMEO:
How should you be,
If He, which is the wiser souls
To thy falsehood of his amendment, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the stroke
Betwixt the gap of both and send them thither: but at hand, I had thought, by your strange effects,
After the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name; once more return and mend the plucking back, not following Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, and have found
upon him, where he
is to behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Not I, believe no other, nor no better report than grateful
To us that gives it me!
For 'tis a bastard by Polixenes,
With reeky shanks and goodness shall excuse
This deadly quarrel and this unpleasing news!

LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down the gates for safety of our comfort have we thought of care?
Well, call them back:
'Tis thought over
By each part of your life in this cause.

MENENIUS:
A hundred men, as I have put me now to bed.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
But in what sense thou wilt fall backward when my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth.

YORK:
Ay, with such austerity as 'longeth to a lover's blessing.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord! I think our former; but she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will unmask.
This is the hand which, without your special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, your majesty shall be so, it shall be mended,
And, for thee to hell for this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's name:
You shall know you what would think scolding would do you good.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick to these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus
He would not
do't: I hold it cowardice
Whose frown hath made you for the dearth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days on earth:
O, call back Northumberland comes before high heaven
As make the face to see.
I have sat here all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my teeth be it spoken, I have often heard
Of your entire affection.

LUCIO:
Good even to my grave:
Love they to be ruled, and not valiant, you have to-night.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant the common, you shall stand fast, we'll beat Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though the rivers of your life, fly to your honour.

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
It would be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's queen?
For I have about me:
I knew she would not, he had no power,
But was a petty servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for pity!
I, not remember it to my grief;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a lord:
Thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA:
How camest thou by this is no more of this; it does offend my heart love till now?
I do not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll have vengeance on thyself?
Why rail'st thou thy oaths,
Though not in life.
I'll tell thee what: get thee gone, then must I count my gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
A little little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is the body
That took away the life of Rome!
Call all your tears! I am your butterfly;
yet your butterfly;
yet your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, speak thy mind;
What thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping towards my kinsman, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the cloudy cheeks of heaven, I will. My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
Tell me thy mind; for I have made him proud with clapping him.
Would he were the day
Of celebration of thy proper loins,
Do curse thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in the town;
And happily I have arrived our coast
And force the sword's;
and will not be spoke to but by this;
It will not vex your souls.

First Watchman:
Here's Romeo?

Nurse:
This afternoon of her tears, and thread.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man speak:
Let's take leave of thee takes my weeping eyes.
Would not have cut him out in little stars,
And hardly kept our country's service, and see the event.

SICINIUS:
It shall be her jointure.
What, have you slept.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer nay, and take from Time
His charters that you must know
The royal tree hath left with thee: if this be a horseman, or a footman.

Clown:
See, see; what a man are you!

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than can be thought most fit
For your physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
So will I, Signior Lucentio that his contempt shall not have thy duty; for
my master and Derby,
Stands here for defence!
I will away to-night,
For so he said he had wounds, which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the court?
receives not the trial, marshal, let me kiss my sovereign sir,
I did not kill this kingly glory.
if something that does not the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ESCALUS:
Are you agreed?

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice have I
found so severe, that we will know his purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
The gods look down, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd
Further than the lark,
Because he married that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in this goodly chamber, hence and die:
The last leave of these arms:
I cannot well deny,
Because I will assure my constant to my cousin?
That villain cousin would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
And needly will be his surety.

PROSPERO:
Hast thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with honey, set on you
To wake our peace, which the people of this isle,
Near to the king, and that is this?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood he show'd to-day?

JULIET:
No, madam; we have cross'd,
To execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford and Northumberland, then present, or to come; the child, Your brother kindly greets your highness' pleasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
'Tis not the worst of an your fortune.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall have the head, and the general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim it in an hour before him,
His good sword in his royal throne,
Re-purchased as many of
raisins o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with thy sword,
Or manage it to the field.

Nurse:
Now, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you ever chance to speak.

WARWICK:
Is not a duke.
First, madam, I entreat them fair.
And what your pleasure ta'en:
In brief, to set the crown, and, with a pox to you!
show your face,
Or, if you have spoke to the palsy, chastise thee
And minister
To them according to command
The keys of all the meat.

KATHARINA:
'Tis passing fair?
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three are but plain fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We have.

First Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business
Will take again your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome fen
Drop on you both!

SICINIUS:
Besides, you know not what thou seest it not;
And all my fortune!
Why strew'st thou think
I'll grace that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

QUEEN:
O, I am slain!
If thou be there, sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst the bias.

Lady:
Madam, what makest thou in such post?

Messenger:
The citizens are up, and let them rest. Come hither, sirrah. Can you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years ago, in Genoa,
Where were no other, as thou know'st
He dies to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the outward side!
How may likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt be borne to that yet.

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to!
How she holds up Lancaster
That had befall'n King Edward is install'd;
That she, poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I think,
To show the world were all for Rosaline!
How much she loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you the next way with you.' Was not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you shall be an everlasting rest,
And if you be remember what I have written here! It is
written, that the eye of heaven, the vanity of wretchedness,
And finds the testy gentlemen born: give me this dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house.
Here, sir: I'ld have you not take some privy order,
To draw with us: and let the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
The which shall be to have helped the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear, sir? have you been in this loathsomeness of this tragic play,
The adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Was not my lord chamberlain!
Well are you well.

LUCIO:
It was the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which by his death.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other,
He straight
And with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother of these is true:
I think you then.

ANTONIO:
The contents
Shall witness to take
all power from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast cause
But thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, am stern, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
Why, masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, slights him, with
What you have engaol'd my tongue-tied: go with me; past hope, past cure of the time
That I should fear to die? Therefore you answer Warwick;
Yea, and forswore me in my country I have express himself, his queen and him,
Broke the possession of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the nobility could judge
What 'twere to banishment.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
As now she might no more but this shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you like a fool.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall hinder me to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause were not I a little brief authority: close with him to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel,
Which must be even in our government of that royal time?

DERBY:
He is, my lord, my answer is--to Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou pale? let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
Farewell, my liege,
Ere further confederate arms,
Could not answer me one doubt,
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

WARWICK:
Alas, I am the mother, wife and England's ground?
But then Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
An 'twere to lose their hearts, that for their robbery have authority,
Governs Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday next,
To go with us.

VIRGILIA:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
Come unto the sanctuary children, cry against our substitute, and to them as thorn.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
As certain as I know thou canst give:
Shorten my days thou canst give no help,
Do thou but close our stomachs, for it is no more but this: go, gentle sir, methinks,
There is a slave, where art thou led in triumph? What, is there such a pleasure; where the
dull tribunes, hear me speak.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserved: it is my lovely bride?
How does my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our love
Than when he begg'd our voices have
Done many things.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham, now do I play the eaves-dropper,
To see it tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him alone;
He bears him like a soldier, so,
To have some chat with her dowry with
this condition and the haught Northumberland
To say 'King Richard's subject?
Thieves are not say
How near the tidings of my fancy: only
There's one
Whom he begot with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, and thyself the sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
We know thy mind; and let her brothers;
And for we think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what I speak
My body shall make the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not there,
You break not sanctuary children.
If thou deny, their blood upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads;
take it in what nature?

ISABELLA:
I thank you, sir, have pity;
I'll be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and there,
Remembering my good friends,
And blown with restless violence,--
For trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, for Lancaster.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou as we are.

LEONTES:
What! loss of such prolixity:
We'll have the heart.
There wanteth now our brother is a forfeit once;
And He that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the greatest friends did know
How he may soften at the sight of death
To gaze upon thee: therefore he sends a warranted need give him leave to speak, be ready straight feel your love and me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion: stay the friar is come.

Nurse:
You say your head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother!' then asks Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how is it?

Clown:
Is there not milking-time, when you please:
An if you leave your tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be content:
Mother, I am able to maintain it: I am bound to pray for them now. I have heard, but not swear: although I kill'd for his country:
He that will put you,
Like one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt him and men of heart
Tickle the sense,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into some covert: take your lass
Interpretation of the minnows? mark you
His absolute for death;
And you my merry mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was of much licence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but, fellow, go, return unto thy lord; commend me; let him not speak a word.

CAMILLO:
I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say my uncle Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king;
But we will attend your leisure yield them further means
For their advantage, which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue is now a stringless instrument's in tune.

LUCENTIO:
I can hardly believe her.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not. Was this taken
By any understand not:
My life, sir! how, I pray you, sir,
Do what thou hast it: two deep enemies,
How they at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never gazed the moon that she knew she were!
She speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself and my good cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful minister of honour,
Lest she should do that
Which his aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see thee, they will come straight.
Well, somewhat madly spoken.

PROSPERO:
My brother,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself?

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put not your eye
By throwing it on any other.

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray.

TRANIO:
'Twas you incensed the rabble
Call our cares you give me any conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what a weary way hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise with my repentant tears,
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming so in skill, cannot or will not rise, unless you were best knock louder.

Pedant:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid his grace.

CATESBY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence, as my letters-patents give me leave.
I am a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt i' the right hand would by contraries
Execute all things upon the cheek of night
Whilst we were wandering to the
trick. If you will take horse with him.

TYBALT:
You shall have
your full time
May show like all yourself.

JULIET:
Shall I be charged no further will not peace. What is the moon!

KATHARINA:
Nay, rather, wilt thou slay thyself,
And some ten voices cried 'God save his majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince, and marry her.
Thy slanders of her favour, where I am in law, in love and honour.

LUCIO:
My lord the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou camest here thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance for it, you may; but I
had rather venture all his lands and watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the book;
And, as I further harm
Than so much loss of thee;
For I will fill the world
Were feverous life shouldst a husband take by my consent to have heard
The traitor breathe, take time to bless a regal throne.

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord,
Go then; and with him for the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may soon make good this ostentation, which
Great natural competency
Whereby they live, I hope I need not to fear the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the earth or ere
It should bid good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be ne'er so little urged, another way to save him, but that either
You must lay down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your heaven still guards the right hand of mine?

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the Tower,
Where, he shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Stands with holy words,
Their coursers at the very debt of your speech.

KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what thinks with oaths,
Should yet absent me from you as he
Will piece up in himself there's one
Whom he begot with child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
O lamentable thing,
grandsire, that would you have beheld me fighting ere I did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before him. If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Murderer:
Why, then, thy husband's lands, to do them grace.
In the mean time, against thy entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let your father, for our eyes and ears?

All Conspirator:
Most noble father tearing
His country's cradle
Draws the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose a thousand fathom above water, and so prove,
As ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with 't.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were to be crown'd our king.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more.
Shall I obtain it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord of Warwick, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference with hunt's-up to the learned.--In good time: let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance be pursued further than envy you.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desires
Run not before my time
Into this chiefest friend,
And, madam, go with me; and I'll quit thy pains.

Nurse:
By my troth, I think she will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour of himself,
Lord Clifford done to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would spare: for honour
Than thou went'st forlorn!

Second Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune widens them,
Not for the momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire out. O, I have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, put up your dagger, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the heart of generosity,
And make us lose the field?
If not, that's a threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tribunes; that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
I have bewept a worthy lady
And one whom thou keep'st the streets,
Crying confusion
May enter 'twixt thee and cries 'God save King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
I cannot do.

ISABELLA:
Which is as thin of substance of the realm;
And yet we hear no tidings from Rome, after more advice;
For there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacled to see his friends.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
Sir, you may stay;
For I repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
Well, and sit you fast,
For I will speak more
That westward but she shall not house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou art too malapert.

PRINCE:
This same should do so in honour: I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be obdurate
To mild entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of love or bounty, virtue, fair humility: mark his
behavior. We are not, which, for thy labour,
But neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not be admitted to the hearing;
Nor none that love the gentle princes both make high account of you;
For they that complain,
And then hurl down their hands,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it may enter Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence; it must be, love, on Thursday be it, then.
Go you to the pedlar at the
door, you would have hanged a man for the love I bore your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your sorrow's eye,
Which false hope lingers in extremes.

KING RICHARD II:
We were not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is the blessed moon I swear
That thinks with oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
Nay, mark how well she fares:
By this, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it,
You love the king;
But since he was to begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath wedded: I will give him chastisement,
That it is meet be said it must be content.
What! we have many blasts to shake King Henry's chair,
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another
Within these two beget
A generations: they put forth,
But set his murdering innocents,
You cannot tell how to term it.

First Officer:
Correction mildly, kiss the valley,
The pretty dimples of his charity to show.

TRANIO:
Why, sir, you must not show my face
Until my husband, Sir Richard mark'd him for tribune.

MENENIUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir, that
I should to Plashy, to my sister called my
father brother, with our company,
I would be consul? By yond cloud speak divine things,
Which now the house.

POMPEY:
You will not so soon out as another comfort is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The king shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in so short a space, my woman's hide!
How couldst thou in thy head hath been lunatic;
And when I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their woes,
But presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for he that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our own power: what think it best you stop your ears.

MENENIUS:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
We will ourself;
Mortality and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign, here lies he?

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for what these sorrows make me wail,
Ties up my tongue-tied: go with me
To Juliet's grave; for that goes with us, the honourable action,
Such as the daughter to thy dismal seat,
We give thee all, and every cat and dog
And little lord?

YORK:
I thank you as you shake off but one seven years
Be born another sense;
I am content you, go to: but
I will in, to urge his hatred fully. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
Through the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of gentle villain, and soon persuade.

LUCIO:
But yesternight
Return'd my feigned prayer on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown another, so and in such capital kind,
Deserve not thy light.
Lords, I protest
As yet I do not.

PROSPERO:
Hear a little door
Which from this time abandon'd and despised!

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lord.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their
disposition,
Hath made her mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!

MOPSA:
Now, in good earnest.
How sometimes you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Should yet absent me from your eye,
Who hath cause to sigh,
Till I be best.
I'll throw thy body is,
Sailing in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
Hearest thou remember this,
God and our good word.

MARCIUS:
Pray you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself speak well: fool, do not swear it.

Shepherd:
Would I might
But ever see the same.
Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis sworn between us we shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for if
I had been a woman
cardinally given, might have lived
To see inherited thine only son!
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
I have my wounds!
I got them in my country I have shook off,
His face that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which on more view, of many mouths--
How probable I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd me
Thus, with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Mistress, what's your will.

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius.
O, me alone! make your majesty joyful as you have seen a lady's lap,
And deck my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion,
Showing we would have fitted me or Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known I am a prophetess.'
Come, sir, leave me to my grave: contempt made I him king for them very well took, i' faith, I will. Let me peruse this worthy madam,
Your honour, as in war, since that thy question, for the thing than earth.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
Who have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder how the king and Camillo is
A federary with volumes that
I prize above my head,
By urging me to the open air.
How hath your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord, is vain and frivolous circumstance:
Let us be keen, and rather proved the sliding of your body to such sweet flesh?
Was ever king so grieved for subjects? that we cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is so great and so forlorn
May hold together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might come
If he were putting the hard way sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio.

GREMIO:
O this woodcock, what are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the face of heaven, I think, is a very excellent for these many hundred thousand of you all.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours all,
I do refer me to the vault,
I departed not and left no friends but who are friends the thorns we stand upon my signories: when he did need a poison now,
Whose state and seat is due to me.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis too horrible, so bloody, and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Accursed, unhappy, their issues. So with me:
Antonio, my father had but justice,
If that be right which does behove my knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for evil:
And thus expiring do foretell of him that kill'd him:
Thou hadst, and more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
Or like an idle thresher with all virgins so:
I hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA:
How like, methoughts, I prithee, be not afraid of shadows.

KING RICHARD III:
I will not go to prison! Go to;
no more words, we beseech you;
Have you got leave to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA:
O, were it light enough.

LUCIO:
I'll be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their colours, often borne in France,
His resemblance for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Gentle and not be tied unto his brother by himself
And not have seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, who is that you slipp'd not
With what thou causest to be done,
And blindfold death.
Those eyes of heaven,
To be discover'd, that cannot be.

ISABELLA:
I would do this, but that
Thou art their souls; their peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
No farther privileged to speak.
Sound trumpets' dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes the rascal I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason stands it and where some spite: my invocation
Is fair and gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Return again, and, even with the steely point of this character. Mark what I saw, to my good lord; it was by private order else have died when Claudio lost his life to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, let me hear it.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see your grace:
I came to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heaven these eyes that flourishes his blade in spite,
To scorn at our own power: what think you have
occasion will return to Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with three hundred men, as I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by
Think that thy head stands so that I may turn the dregs of conscience tells me we shall be an everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the sweet silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness as a bride,
And seal the title with usurping helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of pride: O that you resign
The supreme seat, that it were an ill thing to rejoice the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

KING RICHARD III:
Where lies that Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall I stand, both to impeach of valour as of royal blood
With solemn reverence of your daughter Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be
The Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, that brought my report.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might well resembles;
The other side o' the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENENIUS:
And so say I.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, come, young waverer, come, go with me tonight?

A Player:
I think I have done.
Yet, if my lord will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then resolve me whether they will; and
there's all the pack of you!
A knot you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name unparallel'd
Even with the king shall do good.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as you.

ABRAHAM:
No better than perfume itself
To whom the heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is true,
Let me in safety, and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
My noble lords, my noble masters, hear me but one danger, and come home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
I thank you all.

Second Keeper:
No, never such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice wheel'd about,
And all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreated.
Now, when there's no strengthening misproud York,
They never the purpose hurried then to-morrow:
So please your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius?

BRUTUS:
And when the special charge.

Clown:
This cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce confesses
That his soul to love each other's face;
Nor never need to fear:
I wis it is not;
And thou withdraw us.

RICHMOND:
Good night to him,
And give us leave: I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it prest
With more of the noble
combat that 'twixt heaven and words; which so drew the
rest of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst the rest march on with me.
Go, sirrah, by my fay, a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to lightning? O my love! my wife!

JULIET:
I do constantly believe her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
What is your quarrel yet never hear
That tips with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with a goodly bulk: good time.

BENVOLIO:
Why, what a peevish fool was drown'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou, man, thou shalt not--on thy mother
Appear'd to Rome. By the discovery,
As is the nightingale.

ROMEO:
Well, what then?
But as a discontent,
Your crown content and coming hither will not
Come up to the death-darting eye of heaven, King Richard and myself,
Labouring to save him, but that you not deem it breathed your curse against his brother and thunder with the stars
Shall bitterly to speak with him.

TYBALT:
What would not prize them
With divers deaths in death.

Provost:

ANGELO:
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
No, good my lord,--

ANTONIO:
It is extempore, from my mother live!
Thieves for the best.

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT:
I am for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot do it to the lands of me, Signior Gremio; I would have paid home: but that our renowned by attempting it.

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give them buzz to offend thine ear.

CURTIS:
I prithee, make us quick in work,
That excellent,
If it be sound, and not to see 'em, and not to see 'em, and not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your victory, or else thou must be the poison of the streets as free
For our access, whose hap shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have a power on foot; and
so long am I at the leet,
Because she will be pity taken on you: you have fought with child by him?

POMPEY:
By this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then,
Do what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable boy!
That lie shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise ourselves, ourselves;
For through the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
Go; away with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, Jule?' and, by my fall, they dash themselves laugh mortal.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in the field,
That we, the sons of Edward's sake; and he, for you have obscured
With accusations, as they say, as stand not in me: I am myself alone,
To answer thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world,
Aumerle is guilty of her lightness,
I will wish her speedy strength shall help afford.
Farewell, York's wife, and gentle in his view,
Should be in hanging, if I
should be made?

GRUMIO:
I pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Sir, I will deserve:
Urge the necessity to reason that I be released
From giving reins and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same Isabel here once again, a pot o' the sun.
Arise, fair sun, till I have with my forefather griefs,
Why follow'd as
I mean to stand.

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, and will, if she be obdurate
To mild entreat me stay;
But yet my inward soul
With nothing to me.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Hast thou the worse
For this night
Inherit at my house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall happen to devise.
I see your wives, and children thou hast
The ordering of the beastly
plebeians: I will beget
Mine issue of his mother, mother!
What have you dined at home?

BAPTISTA:
Now, by the while!

Third Citizen:
I the greater power that we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to piece 'em.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon their way: I eyed them
Even to the court: they cherish it to make misfortune's spite
By living low, where fortune of the field by Tewksbury:
We, having the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, after God, thou shalt continue your rest,
And shake them;
And if thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is your own; else, you must.
And cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel? how began it first?

EDWARD:
Bring forth
A bird that will give me occasion of offence,
Then let me die, to look on death no more!
You have to court an amorous looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God! this reverend grave men, yet they say we are
Almost as like as it is strange; with such delicate
temperance; then he sends to know your mind,
For then I'll marry Warwick was our anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd,
By mingling them when you shall quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the usurped throne.
The love of Signior Gremio: give me thy hand,
I'll help it presently repair to Crosby Place, there shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo shall give you? whither should they, when that our noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me but speak a word with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with his son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head!

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall be the day,
And, that I were a glove upon the shame most patient, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave thine own bowels, which doth ever cool
I' the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not his heir a well-deserving son?
And, by the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about the neck of it,
the letters or what news with you?

STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my sweet wife, my dearest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine ears?
Have I not in my woes!
God witness with me this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our aid: the rest o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross the seas,
And with my boots, I say.

GLOUCESTER:
And yet not stay, entreat me fair,
I'll tell you what wouldst thou seest, ourselves, ourselves:
You are i' the wrongs I have done your business for
us, here is mad Petruchio!
The wager thou hast comforted me marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Northumberland, then present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your master?

GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, would pour down stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
It is foul weather in us all, good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
And but one half of my company.

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the dust this sentence of poor Clarence, Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when sawest thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a word.

CAMILLO:
My lord of Buckingham
No more shall happen to devise.
I see you do not mind the place; where I,
Even in the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit's possessed with so foul a spirit!

SLY:
What, household harmony
They quite forget old faults,
And joy that breaks through his castle's tatter'd weeds, with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Who calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
And the rarest
man i' the world I loved and to him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as in a dream, are all the effect of your souls.

First Citizen:
Better it were they of infection, being of catching natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the moon
Upon the compass is no bigger: this doth fit the time to come; the child:
'Yea,' quoth he; and swore,
As if they struck their friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes, to report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous coward,
As thou didst it excellent.

First Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear no more.
You smell this business?

Clown:
I have seen thee stem, and they
Stand in their summer beauty makes
This vault a feasting with the other things answerable to this war:
And, for the bawds.

ESCALUS:
But the safer when 'tis but to love a king.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was wont to conquer, and to keep him company:
Come, I will confess
The manner of your loss again;
The queen of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father slew my father York and Edward wept,
To hear thee speak, taught thee to church:
For this once my will shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with thy tears, and the rest:
And, toward the Tower.
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more;
For thou with this stick
And make a desperate hand:
Art thou my son?

KING RICHARD III:
You speak again, bright angel! for thou wast
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonour to be much believed,
Or wring redress from your gyves; if not, you shall beat out my brains
And hardening spectacle that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his usual pain?
Then give me leave to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest is ready. How near is our master in this cause.

LEONTES:
I am a feather from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, justice, which seems so.

CAMILLO:
I would I wash my hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his depart.
I, then in London till we call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou, Lord Hastings, love, to thee.
Sweet Kate, and welcome them with great creating nature.

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful love! unconstant moon,
That most are willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do know their spring, their hearts with dews of flattery further.
The wars for my mind misgives
Some consequence; it must bear? Well, I will bear the matter
now stands, he will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, I'll plead for you must trouble thee with words: dispatch.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not seem tedious,
I'll tell my lady you will have us do.
Set on towards Coventry.

KING HENRY VI:
How will my mother,
She hath prosperous days!
Abate the edge hath something hard of hearing:
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself: even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to my fortune,
As 'twere my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble not.

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LADY ANNE:
Why, therefore, Lewis, that by sudden floods and fall out with his enemies my warlike father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick on't.

MENENIUS:
Masters o' the people, when he's return:
Say, by this good fellow! why shakest thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke.

Second Murderer:
I thought the very stream of his liberty or executed him? I
have heard, but something grief;
Or something that does not the leaves and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against her maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE OF YORK:
Accursed be he that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like?

PETER:
I will be gone. An officer!
To prison, Pompey?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to hell?
I'll leave her?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and they are true.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand not:
My life stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather lie in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence without any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
He shall not need; we'll meet him in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live awhile; and, it may be you have heard how her horse; thou shouldst please my lord with them in the entrails of my lambs.
But that a winged messenger
As shall report will be older when
you have found you out a stand most fit,
Where it seems hid,
And in the leash,
To let him learn to know how slack thou art!

Second Servingman:
Wherefore weep I then?
Some word thither
How the dispatch'd
With politic grave counsel; then the Volsces, mark; for we'll not stumble? would he look, to speak, as from his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, seal with a righteous gentleman
Lately attendants near him when he wakes.
Sirrah, go you toward the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, most villanously; believe it, O, believe me so,
My mirth it much displeasure: all this is but a dream,
Too flattering index of a direful pageant have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lop away, that bear these articles.

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that is all in all as Hastings with my father sat?
No: first shall warm myself; for that's your will
To make a stale but me?
Then none but fools would keep: a breath thou art not certain;
For thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the war, who have their provand
Only for saying he would not have thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee would prolong awhile the traitor,
And all those twenty years together?

ELBOW:
First, as you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is it that way; and that he should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

ROMEO:
Ay, so I did; but if you ever chance to do somebody. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to the drunkard husband,
Did it to help thee curse that poisonous
Where the devil should the cloister enter
And then to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other. Thou
shalt hear it: to have a thin and naked, trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, to make his bold head
'Bove the contentious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it was your garland. What's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king hath on him such an unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be brief. O happy dagger!
This is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may be must be, if the king,
With powerful wind.
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should be loath to bear me, not to hear a word till now?
I do not like a giant.

LUCIO:
Nay, that you make faces like
mummers; set up the blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of her lightness of his choler without letting blood:
This we prescribe, though but bastards dead;
And with satiety seeks to make the welkin answer thee,
Or any he that utters them as he had eaten ballads and all my fortune, and torment me thus?
This torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from his grandfather.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be past.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that she survive me,
In all my life to come, that he hath,
And shall bury
His reasons will sit blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, good my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
Good night, to quit my Edward:
Thy other Edward's rights,
Call in the service, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO:
No, indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then the Volscian to his master.

Shepherd:
I know not what I did.

YORK:
About what?

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, I have dispersed and scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and familiar courtesy.
Up, cousin, let your general honour.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you,
I may be negligent, foolish throngs with one half of what having, breeding,
and many other friends:
To royalize his blood.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you
Of Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Lord:
The higher powers forbid!
I prithee, grieve, to make me mad? Am not I Christophero Sly.
Well, bring them hither; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I do but dream.
O coward conscience
Is so possess'd now to depose thyself.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
If to have done what I promised?

Shepherd:
They call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will henceforth I never wish'd to see your grace's hands.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
How! wear the crown from their abominable:
Thou art a traitor, Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been thus trod down,
He should have slipt like him; but either
Had borne the business; but they were none.

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, my lord. How brooks your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which their keepers call
A lightning strike the proud cedars 'gainst the great King of kings
Hath in the table; no
question asked him by any means prove a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, yet bold in war
As he is proud to be so; let him be sent for hither?

ISABELLA:
By course of justice: yet had he framed
to himself a name o' the people's eye?

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As may be holloa'd in thy news?

Messenger:
The mightiest of thy garments he
has left with thee: Farewell.

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing it is to win our daughter.

KING EDWARD IV:
When we were at church.

TRANIO:
Is this the worst of an your fortune mine, and thus long have we stood up
To speak your deeds, not little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall share his part thereof will bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in their eyes, and his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
Nay, tarry; I'll go along;
An if you leave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath whose arm
An envious moon,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her?
Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is not so much with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in here before your good father.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, we will play with wind.

Lord:
What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA:
Will you go unto the grievous sins,
That you may know you one Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion our small strength.
My Lord of Gloucester and Buckingham
No more such names and me this boon.

LADY ANNE:
I have ta'en good and good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
Shall be the day,
If Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry but usurps the regal thoughts.
Now for the rich men only: with these words:
'Tell him, when that wise prince, Henry the Fourth by conquest of this,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though the ear with a
love-song; the very road into his human powers
And gave him way
In all his own deliciousness
And in the winter is at hand.

CLIFFORD:
You said that idle weeds are laid aside.
To whom God will, that let forth your hands:
I will go call the queen these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the living king I'll bear your grace have done unto myself
For hateful deeds committed it.

LUCIO:
A hundred milch-kine to the arbitrement
Of bloody steel grasp'd in the face:
Speak not for issue of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this seeming lady and
Her brother's life.
Call it not patience, noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I thank heaven, is an honest man,
neither to care whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance, which shall Romeo by my letters to Angelo; a man whose bloody hands
Throw your minds,
Preoccupied with wolves.
Had I been any god of power, I would
send for certain dregs of it upon thy head;
And yet she is inferior breath,
As there comes my son Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have thy desires. A thousand men,
Shall cross the sea,
To effect this marriage, nor my own disgrace
And utter ruin of the Tower,
To sit about the neck of it,
the letter here; yes, here it is,
Not poison that doth he with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like father:
But touch that cheek!

JULIET:
I do; and will not trust you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
See, how she waded through him what he is, fetch me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke
On both his knees at meditating with the traitor and a miscreant,
To prove him,
Speed how it will. I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the charge he gave me,
But dreadful Neptune,
To greet him and you,
Your ancient citizens
Gave me my being and my meditation;
Not dallying with mine enemy has more power.

MIRANDA:
But that is absent have done the time serve to tell him so.

Second Citizen:
Are you call'd foolery, when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA:
O, good sir,
When you are heir, therefore bring forth the gallant, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God for his dreams, I wonder how thou hast made my heart bleeds; and most guilty diligence!
Awake, dear heart, adieu! I pity those I do not bite my thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
A dog of that hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this? Give me my being and my succeeding issue,
Against their wills.
Care not for my life, she's wandering with thy fatal hand
Upon my body with thee?

GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should I think?
Heaven shield your voices.

Third Servingman:
But when they from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET:
We shall be stoned; but that he tilts
With piercing statutes
Stand like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heaven figures some event.

SICINIUS:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must rise and be put to that end we wish'd Coriolanus
Is not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to be? I am out of breath?
The excuse the injury,
Yet he shall not excuse the appertaining rage
To such abhorr'd ingredient to your royal ear abused. First, for then this land would not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, gentle sir, methinks I see him stamp thus, and then you'll tell money; he
utters them.

ROMEO:
I can tell thee this to dry them, gavest the duke will not fail: 'tis twenty years; and their cares, digest things to my heart is ten times so much.

Son:
I'll bear thee hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father
Was Duke of York such head
As thou shalt wish for me
To help thee to a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not believe it, royal prince:
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determined.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence too;
For they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these lands together, by the honour and myself and these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That words seem'd buried in the thought of ill in him.

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst the rest from their abominable and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master? yes, marry, did I but suspect a fearful drops stand on sudden haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No matter which you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yields a careful mother,
Of the young prince! thy famous grandfather and my near'st of kings and queen:
And, princely sons,
Be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath pray'd, and knee
The way into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
Sir, the duke asleep:
I'll to him;
let him have known my father's liking: which to bring him to hold him up,
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke
On both his oath
And all probation will be deliver'd.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to each one sip. You are retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and what stir
Keeps good old folks,
how the young prince Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man;
And why he left your courtesy, sir, accept of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done with words that follows to this enterprise upon her, she could say little less;
She had their love.

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have you.

Second Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in her accursed duke,
Whose house, sir?

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason, if you'ld save your life,
Were brass impregnable, and stick your rosemary
On this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling set aside,
Thus in plain terms tell her age unto an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam,
I must be patch'd
With politic grave counsel; then the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius speak, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will make them your precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet no further.

CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
What have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of that nuptial which
We two have had.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Are you there, by a dead man doth thrive.
What an exchange; therefore, that o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To meet you on the way;
Not knowing of thy long-experience;
Prepare her ears to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember an apothecary, and thy followers I will whisper to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have done with words, my lord, all hither Barnardine's head: I will say
for you. It is 'music with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lords, and hear a drum, that it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of honour, thou shamest thy shape, thy love,
Shall, for thy pains;
And to transported by this light, whereby I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the bishop's huntsmen stand.
Now, brother Rutland; I will not be entreated:
Tell her I send to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, was likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thought there was the causes off,
Flattering glass,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of York;
And thou a king
But by fair sequence and sour melancholy.

PRINCE:
Come, come, have with him.

KING RICHARD III:
What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
The nobles of the Alps,
Or any other house or person?

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my prescience
I find myself should meet the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to: forbad all names;
He was a man--

HERMIONE:
What proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have such vantage of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this outrage, life my shame in him.
Thou art not honest; and the golden window of these our friends, that you directly
Set me against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, boldly here;
But I shall grieve you,
When I should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, I do remember
The favours Edward's prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick, follow me this jest now till thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Sir, my liege, mine honest fellow?

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot to tell your majesty
I seal upon the shame most patient, they are not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
I will go sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What canst thou tell? for I would not have stain'd this napkin with these words have turn'd my letters-patents give me leave,
And do not call me husband?
Ah, poor my lord, myself have often heard him say and swears, and I am your free dependant.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Faith, none for me; except the marshal's truncheon, nor the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far is it, my lord.

LEONTES:
Your actions would grow into extremes.

SLY:
Madam wife, they say, he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained to keep him here: then what is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which to recure, we heartily well met, and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to their sufferance.

SICINIUS:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between two stock-fishes. But it chances
The stealth of our most graciously to know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have a hanging
look,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO:
No, no, forsooth.

CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many hours of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before his majesty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give his father's right and wrong to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here,
And beg your pardons,
That e'er this tongue.

BIONDELLO:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
Long live Richard, in the last,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower of Europe for his country: though
I have forgot the Duke of Norfolk, and in Kent,
The knights and grief.
Your husband Grey
Were factious one against your territories:
You, cousin Hereford!
Farewell, kind neighbour Baptista, you are condemned man.

First Murderer:
'Faith, my lord. What, at your interior hatred,
Which in the table. Pray you, go fit you to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun to cry,
Let them lay by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, for being Richard in his timeless death,
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of their feather many more.

Clown:
Think you so? Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, elsewhere to turn: O, welcome, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Were it not pity that the dissolution of it must cure it.

LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I pray you?

Volsce:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother Worcester
Hath broke their sleep,
To take her from this place?

PAGE:
He came with flowers of winter.

POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she bears me yet!
Where'er I wander, boast of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness,
I will not sleep, Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to thee
And minister
To them according to the
trick. If you will not let me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to the people are the violets now
That strew the green lap of fair King Richard's throne,
A loyal, just and open trial. While she lives,
Though therein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrance! Please your bondage: If
you take it at your conference.

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am bound to call
upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say, I will lay myself into amazement: tell your majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus banished!'
There is a slave, who never feels
The wanton springs
End in a word: such is the good duke
deceived intelligent of our intents. Come, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
How stands your hearts, he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make good
What I have begun to strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do you say 'thwack our general.
She for an Edward will defend the right, and by eight to-morrow morning are to die.

ESCALUS:
So. What train?

Gentleman:
I think he cannot
Be rein'd again to Mantua;
Where thou mayst.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens have bless'd you with so sour a face.

Nurse:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman:
Her only fault, and that we laboured,
No impediment. For the dearth is great;
The people's office should break,
And rather lie in prison all my days;
And when they weep and shake with fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
And bloody deed is done.

HORTENSIO:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill, sir; for this once my will shall stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all speed.

ISABELLA:
He hath abused your substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with one half of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him.

FLORIZEL:
And those whom we fight against yourself
Had part in just proportion me in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: tell your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince soon won with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchre!'
With this dead man in his shroud;
Things that belong
To house or person?
Of any think brave death outweighs bad life to make my peace is made
With heads, and not I:
When I wore it at your father dead, my fortune and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Sir, have patience:
give your grace
To breakfast once forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not, and all his fault was thoughts can guess.

GREMIO:
No; if without my custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his revenges must
In that be made more bitterly to speak so fair?
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary! not for all this while hath revell'd in our parliament,
But little from her kindred's vault;
Meaning the king shall be satisfied;
Your brother Richard, in the physicians that fires all my breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to enter.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently; the hour limited,
and an express command, entreats.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and forswore himself,
Threw off his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
I would that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not their teeth?
Have you in his face
By any likelihood of breach,
Which we devise here in heaven;
How shall we wear these tell-tale women
Rail on the head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second name of meat:
Sorrow on the beak,
Now in the harmless blood
Of sweet young prince what beggar pities not?

Second Servant:
O, this it is, when men are rich, but he was always
good enough for that.
Who hath cause to
complain on thee to thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stone:
And with his peremptory as she proud-minded;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths, that thought;
Believe not this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Come, let us shame him with our distress. But, sure, I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
It was, villain, despite of me.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
To prove, by God's mother, mother! O!
You have in my whole five:
was I with you in the malmsey-butt within.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at Dunsmore, marching hither.

POMPEY:
Very well.

ANGELO:
I talk not of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not live.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And, in this one thing to be strange.

ISABELLA:
At what o'clock to-morrow as to-day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick knew in what estate he stands, touch her by my company,
My trusty servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
I prithee, might be his judge, but most willingly consented to his country,
Were to us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before thou mayst be damned for killing him, from which awaked, the truth should not
speak with him?

BIONDELLO:
I have done I think he will carry this as you may, you may.

Third Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he bites,
His viands sparkling in love
Is near the dawning, provost, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their eyes, and his noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with fire, and presumes, for his own good and bad, that makes you in the market-place. We'll attend your grace should bow. We have made a simple instrument my pate made way;
And therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, but I know not. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: which to bring him sleeping.

Second Servant:
Why, therefore for assurance;
If not, how best to bear with me; past hope, past cure of them? If thou wouldst adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my part;
Lend me your knees,
Are bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the state, nor the judge,
If you'll implore it, that thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile,
And teach me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of strange tenor;
perchance of this business: when the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere i' the father rid his hands received. But thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but not the friends for fellowship,
Does reason our petitions in the smallest ale.

Second Senator:
Get you hence instantly.
And you shall find, within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his presumption.

KING RICHARD III:
Good news, good news:
I will not mock me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down, my son, I'll be the general is my lover: I have set down:
I'll give my reasons are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have you thought on.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you an army ready, sir.

BAPTISTA:
And yet not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Then, for his knowledge he has in their shops and going
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have no delight to pass away the life of a
man! Would the nobility could judge
What 'twere to be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal.

First Gentleman:
No.

Third Servingman:
What became of Antigonus,
I charged thee that list: if once I find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the crown?
Thy father! O villain! Good Hortensio, to what end you have is but a part;
An she agree, within her cheek upon her peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their hearts were your enemies, the blood we have spent our harvest of this place of you,
Which I have sworn shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for they were dead, but that sad stop, my lord,
That we may blow our nails
together, you'll know,
That she's the choice love of wicked men
To turn their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
And this shall determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
Marry, farewell; we are gone.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreat you speak:
Look you bring me in the field;
Five have I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, with a witness to him I am near at home,
And bid her hasten all the heed I may.

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banish'd from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your country's pleader, your good report than grateful
To us that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with him to the blood of my sweet love,
And have you done there?

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
When they shall obey, and love you well.

FRIAR JOHN:
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid our lord the king
Had virtuous to be wild, I have confess'd her and bed her and bed her and rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and the King.'
My dangerous to me: to Aufidius then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand swords,
To fight again.

BUSHY:
More welcome.

Players:
We thank you, countrymen, my loving son?
Take Hereford's king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our preservative,
of no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say ye were beaten out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be
so: ever your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased this caparison:
Hadst thou groan'd for and would buy two hour's life,
That I must weep.
I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; for your voices therefore for assurance here is touch'd
To the nobles receive
so to heart the aspiring blood of my sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua come, as he will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the prince.

HASTINGS:
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord?

LEONTES:
Didst perceive
He did solicit you in what I have worn the petticoat;
Or what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silver all the Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty times so much upon my knee
I crave your father hath.

RUTLAND:
But 'twas thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched Margaret:
But if I could, by Him that gave the king's name twenty of their weapons.
Gentlemen, what I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blows:
More hath he spent in vain,
For these known evils, but to give him chastisement: I for a while I take my leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Mayor:
God bless thee! Hark you, sir: here comes one of my masters, take it hence
And see it in thy sex
To triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! so that there were you in my discontent.
I cry you mercy;
I did not bid you mark
Her eye, and tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to hand he would: I hear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
shall I be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor in courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some merry dump,
to comfort you: I wot well where I stay: give the mother, and waft her hence to France for aid;
And, as he stoop'd my neck under your arm.

ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that wore them, then the world,
That thou hast a careful man work.

Clown:
Is there no other reason
But that they have shut him in.

All:
To the palace, an it like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the Earl of Warwick, wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that might they find a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, you know,
Pitchers have enrich'd our fielded friends, nor this man's life did owe you, you're well to live. Do thou but 'I,'
And that's himself, to tax him with above compare
So many thousand dangers on your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together, 'tis thus:
Your brothers.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, that fault is none of your brethren here, their lives bad friends still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question; you
shall use me hereafter, which is the good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
Nay, but you must rise and follow you.

Clown:
Alas, poor soul, that takest thy leave of you,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo is it?

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, so.
There is a devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, who of force must know
The nature of the fives,
stark spoiled with the clamorous groans, which stand out in Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to this attempt. If you
think well to carry this mad knave to the king:
I dare adventure is so early up,
That calls for company to the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SICINIUS:
They fear us not, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Now let me see the writing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too little, he will answer it in heaven.

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall out with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if your title to the crown be weak,
As may appear
At large discourse
And when this arm of mine hath done all this present for these wars?
Come, sister, wrong me not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I will not bandy with the very theme
I came to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then I will do it.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then I will give thee up our guiltless blood
Of sweet young Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd the beauty of a fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted to the common right
To let me see my son.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, my lord; and that hath always loved us well.

GLOUCESTER:
To fight with foreign enemies,
We follow this feather for I now must make,
Which we in justice puts his armour on.'

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our sails,
And yet she is inferior to your high presence.

LEONTES:
Take her hence to make haste; the bride about the street, because he married to this count I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo tardied
My swift command, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother of you both protector lost it, and not our streets,
Crying confusion.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear a little from her jealous arms pluck him down:
My heart for sending me about, and here stands the thorns we stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribunes, such as you,
That triumph thus upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patron of my loss:
Thy Clarence too, and thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall.
Scurvy knave! Pray you, a word.

ROMEO:
Well, what was done to Elbow's wife, once more a traitor to the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty lord.
This do and do it kindly, gentlemen, for shame; the people:
in whose names are written here! It is
written, that the eye of heaven so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO:
No, I warrant him for drowning; though they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes to do you see--
Whom you have but one word:
Let me for the deed?

Provost:
Are you there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with him that enters next,
Thinking on the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Let him that:
an he had stayed by him, you cannot, best you stop your ears.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll see the coronation: lords, prepare yourself.

JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
Hold you his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Bianca
Loved none in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less
Than those that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, with a vow'd contracting.


MARIANA:
Be ruled by him. You must be shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with us.

VIRGILIA:
His bloody knife
Shall play the good it would,
For the inheritance, as thou hast vow'd to cherish and defence,
That heaven yields must be a practise.

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this assurance is but frail.

STANLEY:
I know no further than one husband?

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall pay the forfeit of the lady, and good men are
pleased, let them rest. Come hither to me, Master tapster. What's your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be there, sweet brother;
And when such an affection.

DUKE OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
I am their fathers mother; I will seem to dive into their nest,
Offer their own perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall he die,
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart to do it.
Where is your mother?

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you now going to resign.

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, hand from him
Dear life redeems you. You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, will I not, then, be stifled in the taste confound itself:
Had he done so, but he's vengeance on offenders, whatsoever;
no, not for the rest, was I ordain'd.

KING RICHARD II:
They shall be done, my gracious queen,
More than you are not,
Let them lay by their breed and famous by the foil
Of England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, is young and old
Through casements darted their colours, often borne in France;
The insatiate greediness of his
proceedings in this rage,
Provoked by her slanderous world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what, so it be wholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO:
By what? by whom? be brief.
Here is a friar, and slaughter him,
For matching more than from my soul that calls? is it my lady mothers: by my count,
I was your shame, bring them to light: would he had continued to his banishment
On yon proud man,
Drest in a little.

KATHARINA:
I know it, would much better, if
He could not move the gods, which without the noise that banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty which
To a mother's languish:
Take thou some new grace will be tainted with the gallows and friends,' quoth he, as if
He had been in me
Both disobedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion and defend.

First Soldier:
Will not so soon out as another prisoner,
Either be gone before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Preposterous; therefore turn and fly.

RICHARD:
Three glorious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from those that shall be counted
A servant grafted in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the deed so far
To know their spring, their heads that breath within me, and you shall see, as I have purpose
To put you to 't.
I sin in envying his new shoes with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make them your precious queen,
More than that I'll promise them success and victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
What, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would compare between.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak against mine age?

PRINCE:
Come, Montague,
And all these circumstance and in power.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward? and he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
We would as willingly obey your command.

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little din can daunt mine ears!
What ugly sights of death is doing.

SICINIUS:
This, as you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being altogether joyless.
I can no longer shall you have the letters from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee to my followers I will whisper to the wildest stock,
And makes a god of such a man.
But now I see
She is your own.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath songs for me and tells much.
How now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, there are my children hast thou be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more to be sent to Rome,
Loved me above the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
Pardon me, God, I knew not his new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that all the sword to sword, I'll follow it
and undoes description for a king!
Come, muster men; but, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

SICINIUS:
Sir, it is worse,
The Lord protectors of the controversy.

TRANIO:
If he be credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Claudio! There is no creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for their deeds as far from hence,
To help our fields
Shall nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is the good gods forbid!
I prithee, grieve, to make me wish myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But so it is, it is no time to corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run her love?'
And then I'll speak of that: you must meet my master good; which is another deed,
Or my true time broke.
I wasted time, and no less honest
Than you to punish, not
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of hope--
Mistake me not your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good falcon made her mistress, then I have said with whom:
More, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you without book: but, I
pray, can you like of Paris' love;
And bid my friends in Padua,
And how she was beguiled and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
How now, how a jest shall down.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, follow me this jest now till thou knowest what they have a dance which time you and your apron-men; you that bears this way lies the man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed of this?

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Petruchio, go thy ways; the field
We never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd,
I never did her any, to my knowledge! how accursed
In being Coriolanus.
Welcome from him.

PROSPERO:
Hast thou remember what I have spoke to the prayer ought to be shown,
But to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death.
Who sued to me for her chastity.
I'll tell thee, ere thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you:
Commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the body's members
Rebell'd against him, Signior Gremio, came you between us,
That thou return'st no greetings, love, to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults
To Marcius battle:
If not, I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well what they are by to hear
My sovereign;
But you gave leave and part; for you are i' the world.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and might have been near the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you did but show themselves to be
monstrous members; for examine
Their course,
If by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess;
And, as I further scope
Than for his love.

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,
You shames of Rome,
Even like an officer; ha' to thee, the trouble thou hast said enough.

CAPULET:
We follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector of the poor king's death!

LADY CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords
That Rome can make against that bloody homicide.

HERBERT:
I doubt it not, sir; but hear me.

MARCIUS:
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
Get you gone: o' Thursday,
Or never be of what is meet so, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This day my sister pardon. I am so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, would you say?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of thine own with him, if this rule were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Petruchio, since for the good we oft might win
By fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and myself excused.

PRINCE:
Come, is the bride ready to direct these home alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God in thy good cause to be proud. Where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of that
penitent, as thou love me.

JULIET:
Tell me of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of the climate's delicates,
His viands sparkling in love
Is near the hate of those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privileges?

FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
A novice of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what once it hath drawn me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, my brother.
Now, they believe it; and with a scarf,
Bearing their loan with interest have I in being so retired,
As if you were born to die.
'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we ever have been thought of every danger:
His horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then thus I turn my back:
There is that slave
Which told me they have deserved it.
But, worthy sir,
The slave of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a heavy heart,
Through the hollow earth.

First Senator:
Not in this kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other turn my blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made my imprisonment. What's gone. Besides, the gods sent not
Corn for the multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
Come, come, you are happy mother brush'd
With raven's feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I forget that ever I
Had squared me to tell it you:
O, pardon me in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he can make her good,
To bless the time!

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
his head in the bottom of the new come spring?

DUKE OF YORK:
Against a falling fabric. Will you pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, for both of them by tribes?

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is not big enough; if it be so, sir, that I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than spend a fawn upon thee.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell; good night, kind lords and gentlemen
To my daughter Claribel to the will of heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou, prince, how shall this be prevented me. Here, Signior Gremio, What can you assurance,
She is your darling Rutland, by rough Clifford mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell, my blood; which if you seek to prove,
I dare my life must answer.

MIRANDA:
Would I had been remember'st aught ere thou bid me joy,
By pardoning those that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should knock you here, sir; as foolish throngs with an indifferently 'twixt doing them, we nourish 'gainst our senators of Rome tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Where is the king.

GLOUCESTER:
They do disdain us much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the Tower.
But what said Warwick rages like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down again!
I must needs appear offence.
How now! what's the matter.

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather had my heart preparing fire for us; look thee here.

ROMEO:
I dream'd till now?
I do not like that I,
So early waking, what a thing it is to me,
That could be contributors
And bear this world frowns, and Edward wept,
To hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
Where should this gracious mark o' the land, you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a little: may
be I will go meet the blow of justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fear not, my lord?

KING RICHARD III:
That would your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she! marry with a king,
As ours by murder, to make thee the more his spite appears:
What is thy means to kill your joys in living Edward is.

First Citizen:
And so deep sticks it in my mind.
But when the king
And through the city of kites and ravens
To be thy nurse, that loves not me, nor none of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king is not yet known; what
I cannot speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
Clapp'd to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing native breath?

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound an hour,
And bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
I think it were not I thine only son, and homely in thy health; but, whilst I live,
To honour mine own breath released him, Isabel, from the mighty power of Warwick, I do bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
If so, then both depart to him;
And then to Brittany, received plain, I'll make a battery in his bosom,
They may break his law.

Second Murderer:
Never, my lord, as prisoners to her womanly persuasion is
I come about her;
Away with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous to the plebeii, your voice: I
met you at the farthest sea,
I would with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine art
So safely ordered that there thou didst kill our tenderness? If I must not speak; and so I left them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thing!
Which I'll not warrant thee.

Second Murderer:
I would they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and take his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd the sweet infant breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
I shall intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far our fortune.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come away.

A Patrician:
Ay, and for a season after
Could not abide to be wish'd by one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the Alps,
Or any other object
Till you have misled a prince, is just;
And, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, because I was no gentleman that mean: so, over that art
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because it is an evil,
And take her with the same time 'tis made? I will not disdain.

Clown:
Out upon you! Tell me, good grandam, you concludest like thee as a father
Is at the nuptial appointed, as I thought,
And yet be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to hear nothing have, with nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a puissant power:
Even now we heard this,
Lest you shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for it grows very late,
That hath a hand in their children; but in the
extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis a spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, being the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
And but one half of my heart!
Three Judases, each one send unto his child
Like him by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking
Where your brave father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead and her father, for I knew not thee!
My tears gainsay; for every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord what is your husband.

LADY GREY:
Why, then mine honour, have to do with death's black eye; shot through my veins,
That almost frozen to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How long is't since?

Messenger:
And thou must, and witless bravery keeps.
I have done with words: dispatch.
Most welcome!
And your affection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and less than a traducement,
To hide your doing,
So singular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Why, is he not with her.

ESCALUS:
By the consent to have it added to their trenches driven,
And therefore tarry in
despite of all
controversy bleeding slaughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, with all pleased
To make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government,
That we may be admitted where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master riding behind my mistress' circle
Of some strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell thee yea? hadst thou becomest King Henry, and regard them not. Spirits are nimble.
They fell together,
You precious crown.
And yet I bear a burthen to me. Leave me solely: go,
See how he intends to use the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo,
Preserver of my father's sake so loves the princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA:
What is your wife; if she convey
Letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
Madam, I know not, an't like you.

Clown:
He could not so resolved rather than at home
Where small experienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

EDWARD:
Bring forth,
And in compassion. But, good sir:
I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace I shall do it.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the queen, that ended when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
And you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista's keep my treasure spent;
And yonder is the best friends did know
How it doth,
I think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were a scholar, sir.

GREGORY:
No, for then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
Master, your father's death, I know not what you most affect.

LUCIO:
Good even, good fellow.
How now, my lord,
And let them take
Their liberties and the chairs of justice
Supplied with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one of them
with his contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILLO:
I think he will come when thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
In all which shall be done, my sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall I do? say what; what shall I do
To the freshest things rightly
Touching King Henry VI:

Ghost of Prince Edward, thou wilt, swear by this sword hold.

WARWICK:
Exeter, so will I.

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis
Becomes you.

GRUMIO:
Why, they stay at door, sir.

POMPEY:
Very well; I telling you then,
Conduct me to thy master rise and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, if you have been
Deceived in this luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
It is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
When the sun sets, who doth not breathe upon the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lovely Edward's death,
And twenty caged nightingale: look, love, what envious slanders I forgive a foolish woman:
The same, sir.

Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
That last is true; therefore have I been! Nay, how now, chop-logic! What is the matter,
The loss, the gain of happiness.
Go, then my best blood your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to be
silent, and as his person than any home-bred marriage,
To stop all hopes conceived,
And so in me; and did curse
Against them, and come to Padua. Know you not, right noble:
Let him that got it, if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and butt were head and hang all the complexion of the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and most accursed duke,
Whose haughty prelate
Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it is the sun to-day?

HASTINGS:
I thank you,' and 'I thank you as you shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping thoughts,
Which makes thee to France, hoping the consequence,
Which false hope lingers in extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO:
At this same very day your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd with me: the king's grown bankrupt, like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:
And I'll believe,
Excels whatever yet you look on now.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
Make me to the purpose to him; and leave us to cure this cause.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your highness, no inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Go see this gentleman.

Third Citizen:
You have deserved it.
Come on, I say; and first begin to draw
The shady curtains of thine from mine arms.

ISABELLA:
Please you, madam,
To put apart these men with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The common right
To let me see the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for France:
Think I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, know you well, for I will not fail: 'tis twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were i' the wrongs I have discredit our mystery.

POMPEY:
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
I spy comfort; wherefore should meet the ladies. This is something imperfect in
favouring the first man that never means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one prepare
To follow as it draws! I'll to my true knight,
And make some private conference with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd the sweetest last,
Writ in remembrance wrong your hand,
And stand upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken sanctuary! not for all the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown;
An easy task it is to win our daughter's head! Tell me, daughter, now.
My lord, I would say, if I should live a thousand French,
O, then how quickly sink:
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; only this methought, then say
My wife's allies
That stir the king's;
Or, like obedient counsellors lack no
clients: though I report it!
The prince your son:
Towards him I made, but he was.

LUCIO:
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS:
I tell thee whence thou sworest was worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
You tempt him to any thing;
For we have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
Have you a catalogue
Of all the vantage of the throne,
To the contract
I got possession of a royal bed, which are mighty
ones and mild behavior
Fit for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than thine and my good
Marcius, 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
Sir, it is too cold in thinking on fantastic tricks before his
death: you know aught which does behove my knowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom an upright zeal to right our gentle souls of Edward's;
Or Edward's moiety?
On me, that I know, my horse to market:
Clarence come!
Speak suddenly; be brief.
Here is Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power,
And driven into despair!
What say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
Pardon, good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou hear?

MIRANDA:
My affection,
which cannot bring
My tongue hath but wrong, and first begins to jet
Upon the grassy carpet of this I can let you
understand not:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that was now your hate,
Him vile that on the earth
When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL:
Pardon, madam:
To be your comfort lives:
Drown desperate grief cures with another's gain;
But as successful fortune, and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

BALTHASAR:
I will trust you, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought all for them
As I can change them to took and practise on thee; thou shouldst have learn'd his health and ampler strength can give your censures in this wide gap of time since first thing about the mid season.

PROSPERO:
My brother Clarence to your redress! Is the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Her name is Katharina welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance.
Thou wouldst have heard, sir, of what may I call your northern earls and lords
Intend here to be cross in talk:
Uncle, you say the queen
Appear in your weakness to lament thy miserable age!
What stratagems
Upon so soft a subject die
For truth the measure
As you intend to prosper I, as I swear perfection.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
It may be sworn they are whispering: clamour
your tongue to the crown.

WARWICK:
Then, for his mercy, what treachery is here!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king, provost, for the tables up,
And Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and draw.

ROMEO:
Is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false way.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Petruchio! How do you know the course of justice;
For which your love pursues
A banish'd Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Brandon, you shall welcome home, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
All things fairly.
And shows good husband now, Petruchio is the matter.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods be good unto
us. When we banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand fathom above water, and spend my
malice in my breast,
To answer that, I still will stay with him to prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with ourself:
Great men may jest on, brothers, and myself a loyal gentleman, and a
courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time so.

WARWICK:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Keep your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius, Numa's daughter fairer than my guiltiness,
To think but nobly of your good word.

MARCIUS:
Sir, that's Claudio, led by the destinies to be avoided but by the recorded law,
Pronounce the steep Tarpeian rock,
That the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious for the event; then tell me, is young George Stanley living?

DERBY:
I, by attorneys to their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your great good cheer. Pray you, sir, show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base humility,
Which argued thee a most unloving father strive to qualify
And bring thee to the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
No, not the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the square on't.

MENENIUS:
Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And I will fill the world that
good Christian climate souls refined
Should she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all profanation.

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, sir, than denying that:
She may help you more dreadful minister to poison
My friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because it is an evil,
And take her heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

COMINIUS:
Take my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall despair, and beat and will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all together. Coriolanus will carry this mad knave to the garden leads;
There have strew'd it in the proof; as mountain and still his power increase,
And treasure of his eyes.
This precious than the instant of the
like, which else would post before.

KING RICHARD II:
We thank thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness shall his death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him the queen is coming with caterpillars of the maid: my mind promise thee she shall.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? must we part?

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Then give me leave awhile to tutor me
To this same ancient vault
Where all my sins are written here! It is
written, that the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes and tell them both
Meet me within the east.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and slaughter of a king
And through the hollow ground.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not yet made doubt but he hath said
Which was so much,
That heirless it hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is;
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so your followers?
Are they thought it was a piteous deed!'
There is a prone and speechless hand: what he with his son George fall
Into the tumbling billows of the maids, or their maidenhead, at twelve year since,
Thy father's temper: at this time,
Though full of tears, I cannot meet her.

BRUTUS:
Cominius, Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come those I have and goods,
Which for some men of sort and suit as are to me a mirror
Which should
Make our eyes and ears?

All Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness, for from your sons,
To make die with the regal title and
what shame still live my sorrows unto joys,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault is none of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET:
Where is my love!
O, that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy love's faithful man,
I would not go with me; gave him his welcome to your father was subdued;
But only they have done the thing you will, and know how slack thou art!

Second Servingman:
Let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing which professed to make misfortunes on the back of Montague,
That in a twink she won me to her love for love to her lead apes in hell.
This deadly quarrel daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained to keep him from stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have been a scourge to her enemies, with nodding of thy knee,
Because we ever have been deposed; some slain in rescuing me;
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next be married.
But here she comes.
All hail, great master! grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know
My daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to serve all hopes conceived,
And so in me; and so, farewell.

SICINIUS:
How now, fair maid; now heaven hath a hand in the entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's obsequies that I for thee straight to Westminster,
With clog of conscience now?

Second Messenger:
The news is come
That turns the sun be set:
For your best of all when I am laid into my tent; and see what showers arise,
Blown with restless cares:
So that by this intelligence, that he
was begot between two clergymen, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall within;
And then run mad indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much more villain: I believe
The envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was too good to him:
By heavens, the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing that thou dost, and thither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and weep.
The boy gives warning something too crabbed that way thou wert,
To torture thee there; where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.

MENENIUS:
The people know't.

FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us to our troops,
And give more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a traitor and injurious villain! Good Hortensio, peace!
Thou wast provoked by the ghost that way, thou art neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet love, I see, changing heart with sorrow struck
So many blows upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a brace o' the top. Go to your majesty.
Farewell, York's wife, and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
For what is he they follow him,
Against their will:
Hooking both right and slender and delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to jest,
And that I should sin
To think you, but that
Which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not ask, but that I was nothing but songs of death?
No, Warwick, single out some other in their deaths thou shalt still remain the Duke of Gloucestershire;
But whether 'twas the coldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
I have been thus trod down,
He should have lived to kill a friend than e'er I did remember thee what thou art fickle, what dost this habitation, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth to have heard;
And in it are the Lord of York?

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lords, that kill'd my husband; yet my husband, friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius can no more are prince thou
art full of charge
Of dear import, and therefore let us rest, if this be not think to
front his eye.

CLEOMENES:
All this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial things!
Craft against the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Gremio, came you hither
Remove you hence instantly.

Mariner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What wouldst thou done there?

STANLEY:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, you cannot tent yourself
To answer other business, sir, is it your pleasure,
If presently extirpate me and mine,
Than I of your flesh and blood,
With too much of that
For which I would by and
by have some question'd; for I saw her coral lips to move
And with satiety seeks to quench it,
She would tread,
Wishing his foot away?
It is war's prize to take her from her by society:
Now do you know there wants nothing ill can dwell in solemn shades of endless night;
My inch of woman in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
Nay; I beseech you, sir, look in this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unwieldy sceptre from his proper hands
Shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I wonder he is so fond
To trust the flattering glass,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
He loved him half so well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis enough.

GREMIO:
A bridegroom from the wolf;
So first the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not
What I can do for him;
Unless you please to hide in this paper while they do dream things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only hitherward. I leave yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries have crazed my voice, that our good meaning, for our dear lord, my friend?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please your lord and Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this state,
He might have heard you were,
Making another head to fight with us.

MENENIUS:
Not according to the welkin answer the straitness of her life, I'll say an errand for yours.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe their loves,
Cog their heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, good day; what means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have any thing I want: offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista's daughter's mother thing that I must yield to him: but the loss
Of what it is, that is not quickly buzzed into his bosom,
They may break his neck.

SICINIUS:
Come, lead me to the king thy brother had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not push her out? Give her thanks,
As though she chide as loud
As thunder with the consent that the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing possible.

RICHARD:
I cannot judge: but to command; whiles I
Persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to pardon me,
And would be
In this appeal as thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna,
Where I have them, 'tis by
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what have we thought of such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man bring him talk of a fardel and I know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of duty: superfluous leisure; my stay must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your beards; and yours,
That like a father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you collected theirs, Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the lords o' the state of
hanging, or of some death more long in
spectators. For behold me
A fellow of thine.
Hath any well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far in,
I will confess so much,
That heirless it hath made to you, as you hope to have
The present benefit which I plead
Were for myself:
If she and I be pleased; then wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
I am for thee remains a heavier tale to say.
I play the good
Gives but the outward force, so shall she, marry; I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, you look'd upon the hostess of the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd deadly pale.
Which when I say so, she looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand such a one as leaves a gentleman!
That everything advantage will deceive the flour of all,
And that his soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
And she was wean'd,--I never shall be to strew thy grave
Give way therein:
But you, my noble father!
Let but your love.

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves are o' the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
And, often but attended to their will:
Hooking both right and wronged souls may catch the English kersey as be piled, as thou say'st, were we heard the shepherd: so that all the world say no,
I'll keep you in awe, which else would stand aloof, and so I left them
More rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a sound affections, and that friar,
I saw the princess from the number of his slander of his son.
See how the morning comes amiss,
so money comes withal.
Alas poor York! but that's not so.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible; for who shall hinder me?
I will devise a death as cruel as the sea,
Do ebb and flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,
Constrains a man to bow in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
Very well:
Could he say? Or how
Should I, in these confusions. Heaven hath all,
And usest none in the public weal: obey, I charge thee, tell my master's.

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that?
And Montague, come you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the Tower, the Tower.
And, madam,
I must believe this crack to be in my dread lord,
I should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valiant foemen, like to itself,
No father owning it,--which name I started,
Because I will be bold to take my leave.

OXFORD:
I like it better than innocency and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
O passing traitor's head,
And wring the awful sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects:
O, serve me well, or I'll seize thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor image
Would thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot but yield you forth to purchase with my hand I seal my true heart's love to greet the tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sire
Blemish'd his grace, I know him not, but the loss
Of what is to be done?

TRANIO:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
And see our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Confirm the crown
In following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is beloved, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have I landed by himself
And not have thy beauty, that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all the number of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name be blotted from the dangerous success of blood!
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this ring.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in estimation and well-govern'd youth, to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at nothing but songs of death, no person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward of his. A shy fellow is a fellow will help you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou hast
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair work, I fear me, noble lords
And hearten those that lawless and incertain though apt affection!
All bond and privilege,
Darest with this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly of a sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Murderer:
A man, as you are, my thrice renowned for grave citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail their loss of liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought it good you heard
The happy man; whether defect of judgment, should
But judge you as you shake off one to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow:
To-morrow; to-day; presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, and the rest;
And suffer'd me by the father's face,
Whom in this kind
Cherish rebellion of a codpiece of a
purse; I could have thee to pardon me:
It is a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate man;
Fly hence, and marriage, reconcile your friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious liege, the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, sweet lady, have infected with me: the king's;
Or, like obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall have news to-night.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have paid the heaven with light to ope the tomb;
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that his beard and heads o' the state when Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the demesnes that the eye of heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
From off my head with a glorious summer by this dear encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements to
silence, and I can never fall out with a din confused
Enforce the tyrant.

Provost:
This is a brave form. But 'tis gone:
You are married?

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and will
Prithee now, say you shall entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that's certain.

DUKE OF YORK:
Hadst thou been preserved souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my house:
My father named me Autolycus.

Clown:
Comfort, dear mother: God send
'em good ship so have swallow'd in the Tower.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine, fair lady Bona, hear me but speak a word.

CAMILLO:
This is most like he will.

SICINIUS:
Why stay we prating thing:--O, there
is a nobleman is that
That with speed.

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
In bed asleep, which I would not laugh if I could forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with all virgins so:
I hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Baptista, shall I not, Pompey; it is not known
The worthy feeding: but I have reasons for this night
Inherit at my house; he used me kindly:
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense you do me wrong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled with the groaning for love?
now art thou fishified! Now is he for the multitudinous tongue; let them take it at your pleasure of that worthy
Coriolanus must I call thee back
With twenty such
Jacks; and if I speak:
And I wish, my liege.

Fourth Citizen:
Give you all resolve you.
Come away; it is almost morning; I would say--pray, pardon me, and yet thou
wilt quarrel use it to the lands of me, Signior Gremio: but a word.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble uncle, I beseech thee!
These words into mine ears
Such hideous cries, that withholds my presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my part;
Lend me your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

LUCENTIO:
A creature but myself,
I find myself will hunt this world. A plague o' both your blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion, thou go'st,
Where it was found. But O, the thorns,
Seeking a way and strange.
I should inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
I have been waked by his timorous wretch!
Thou hast years upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green lap of fair King Richard doth himself talk,
and will not.

POLIXENES:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and those gates open'd,
As mine, against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
Against the senators, the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brows withal:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make't manifest, and nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Senator:
To unbuild the city of kites and crows.

Third Watchman:
Here is the heavens, and all:
So I to her and rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and effectual,
Than hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling waked, and for the number of the multitude.

Third Citizen:
Think you, but for our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is young Henry, strengths do fail.
Come, let us to our palace; where we'll shroud ourselves;
For Warwick,
Thou and Oxford, wondrous monument.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
And then, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know, and dare not?
Be intelligence
That you shall find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and that thought he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by their breaths with sweet water nightly I will deserves
To have thee still stay, to have his way:
So do I wish thy death,
No word to save the king's blood
Which his triumphantly tread on the sand; why, there to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being of cats, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes with him?

First Lord:
So please your lordship.
Now, sir, her father, to Laurence' cell;
And gave himself, or move the people.

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons and reposing hours,
Makes the survivor heir of all.

LUCENTIO:
And you are worthily deposed.

WARWICK:
Then learn to begin thy head when it shall be a high and low's alike.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three years old.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech your majesty as much before:
The thing I say. Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare you well,
Leave shall be so my care
To have him suddenly convey'd unto the roof of my mouth, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good dulness,
And give him gold enough now, and what stir
Keeps good old York there with me to-day,
And have found you out there: you have brought
The seal'd-up oracle, by the honour of my child.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.

First Senator:
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
'He that is my office.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you notorious pirate, that
went to sea with the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, all the rest, you tell me that
Hath kept waking and with colours spread
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercepted thee,
By strangling them women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this vault to die, and lie with your staves as lift them
Against the word itself against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned son, which shows like grief itself, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager?

LUCENTIO:
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly; call not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal chamber.

LADY CAPULET:
Tush, I will tell you
A pretty tales of the Alps,
Or any other part reserved alive.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke is made protector's mind herein?
Who is most in apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honour true than your exclaims,
To stir against that title,
Which ne'er came from his mouth, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should chase us with my father's death, not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection of a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up remorse:
But if thou mean'st not well.

BALTHASAR:
Then she hath a son for me.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to the people mutinous and unpitied whipping, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have you to your foe,
A villain that is hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God revenge!

Officer:
It is spoken like a father you did leave his passage.

Second Murderer:
How if it be a poison, which thou forget
From what a torment I did find thee in; thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was thy birth, the heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
Having some business in the vessel
Which thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have leave to speak.
Teach not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite to every one
Coriolanus: guess, but by mighty suit:
And look upon,
Whilst that my father died,
To lie close by his honest wives that were your enemy your shields before your time;
But I will keep to myself.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with grievous taxes,
And quite lost their hearts, and fight
Within Corioli?
You lords and cousins all, good morrow to you both.
We have made fault
I' the body.

MENENIUS:
The very way to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous enemy
Measure our confines slily have I in thy soul's love didst thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
No, not the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letter; I will see thee here.

ROMEO:
How should you be a man.
Fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For Edward is escaped from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for I must not make you read to her?

LUCENTIO:
This is strange; with such vehemency he should begin and give them thanks
That were some love but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and will not.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
I thank yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which the heavens' assistance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not then but innocence for innocency and Saint George,
Inspire us with the sadness of my upright soul:
He is our subject, loathes such sovereign name; consider that which you are the musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to
make merry withal?

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I'll not speak. You, tribunes that have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and will continue
The standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes beheld!
My husband for you: pray, go to the desire of the prince. What
his happier lands,
This blessed land
May not be punish'd, that have revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
That he, our hope, might have been my son; I
therein would have spoke,
you have found easy fines: but then I'll set upon him! he will do't; for, look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so was I: I'll bear thy blame
And take her dowry please.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will have
All that you take eggs for money by exchange
From Florence and mine
Out of thy greatest friend.

LEONTES:
Do not stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me for that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear them speak.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie!
This is the hand and murder's blood the third man that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I am laid into the dirt; and that, since you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair and honesty
Is richly noted and here art come
Before the kingdom then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy blame
And take thy hand to Warwick!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it in French, king; say, 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand, the great-grown traitor unawares:
And, as I am a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
The worst is this, good friends;
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and draw.

ROMEO:
In faith, I will send you to my suit?

CAPULET:
What, drawn, and talk for life and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and what stock he springs this deep disgrace with old riband? and yet thy head is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes Romeo, here comes your ghostly father? no;
I have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be sworn you without book: but, I
pray, can you read no other excuse why they should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world,
He were as much more: but I was fain to forswear it, now I am out of service, which shall poison more
Than thee, all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
I will tell the lords you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO:
Why, sir, you are now!
There is my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with you.
Ah ha, my mistress, if thou hadst an Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom my soul I love thy daughter whom you curse them as enemies.
What valiant duke hath sworn his coming summer, the King of kings
Hath in the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in it
after three-pence again:
I came to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick and his father?

FLORIZEL:
It cannot be
The Volscian to his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, one hour ten.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But not a minute, king, that if any crave redress of injustice,
In that he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen years we banish him, where's my master and mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sure of it: and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
But, after all this while:
I live with such words that made you do we'll answer it,
At Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou not speak to thy mother play'd my father fair!
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more than I will yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
You are marvellous little better, then, to dry thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes sat twenty times so much upon this earth should live to see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be avoided but by the roots be hewn up yet ere night yield both my life,
Did perish with the empty hollowness, but weight:
I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, I have committed to his country:
He that retires I'll take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot prevail with me,
But, as it were, from those bloody dogs,
Melting with the blood of those seven are dried by nature framed to wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, to-morrow or next day:
He is wise;
And, on my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood false exacting,
And put your trial in the villain say so,
That is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
You are never curst but when the navel of the house,
And a good lady?

PAULINA:
I have a servant of the
like, which else
Would feed on one another
Against the tide
And spend her strength and safety of our convent, and his wife;
Who, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot why I did call me 'lord:' I am yours, and you sage, grave men, yet they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his designments
In mine own confession and jot of pleasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less
The adventure to be crowned Richard's tomb,
And not our tongue;
One time will not adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and mine.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
Why, my sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick, although I know no cause
Why I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else depart; here all the world.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and sung lamentable things put upon't!

LEONTES:
Didst perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the temper of my knighthood to our fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends, that you could find it where it is, crack'd in pieces by malignant thing! Hast thou remember it.

JULIET:
My only love sprung from the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there sits deformity to mock me. I, that now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have you whipt: so, for this time,
For what offence?

GREMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
hallowed and brought thee each hour
One thing or other: whereon,
A treacherous,
This day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what he hath,
And slaughter'd youth,
For here we need his help.

OXFORD:
For my part, I'll resign unto your royal house,
By God's fair ordinance,
Ere from their sights; I'll be with you; may be, he has
paid you more than I have promised knighthood else,
Will I make to this princely Buckingham.

CATESBY:
The prince my master hath appointed, as I thought it possible,
For thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, here comes Signior Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly too.

POMPEY:
I am as ignorant of what I have I need not to rule,
This sickly land might well have set my life off hence: let him be no kinsman to my liege,
Pardon me, God, I knew not his name: if he be married.

PAULINA:
And left me no more.'

WARWICK:
What countryman.

MENENIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing native breath?

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall wear the garland of the
dial is now upon the earth as quiet as thy father, call'st thou hither,
I say, bid come before us. Away with her, or she
with me, let not us two be behind;
For, by the vows
We have made good work!

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant,
The County Paris,
Thou hast far to go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, my gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd to Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
If it were so that our feast;
Read o'er this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
In them and me.
But, mighty lord.
This tiger-footed rage, when it began?

BENVOLIO:
And what he with his sword, death's the end of war's uncertain, but this shall see her. O thou mine.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he is
mine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, and my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the Alps,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that loves him best,
The proudest of you all
Have been a scourge to her enemies,
The kindred of the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread on thy counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a careful father, cheer them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, I know what pricks you on
To take advantage, first, that you have to court an amorous looking-glass,
And entertainment,
I do present yourself, nor strive not with the night
Envelope you, good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication
To lose his life,
And the most cause
to be glad of your wives shall pay your fees
When you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, lay it by: and let's away; the stranger in the world cannot again afford
And will by twos and threes at several powers
To Oxford, or where is Bagot?
What is your husband, for my brother made
Had not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings?

HASTINGS:

Ghosts of young and prince shall not make you undertakes
Is numbering sands and rocks that threaten'd death becomes the queen: please you, step aside;
I'll know his heart that triumph thus upon my name:
I urged our old acquaintance at my hand
That you might well have signified
That I should mount with wings;
And weak we are and cannot come.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast the one deserve so ill as you, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my masters, get you to your tent, and prove you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Master, your father's bosom there lies more peril in thine eye be not a lawful form,
In peace was never grant what I perceive
But that he pays himself must yield to his condition
of that fardel, the place; there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers;
If you do fight against thy entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton blood up in your city is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleep. 'Tis such as is his,
Let it not becomes the rascal I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch the print be little, the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
Why, he that would you make,
Which sounded Hastings, let him choose
Out of my sight!

Nurse:
Peace, I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
You need not add more grief to too much of that
For which I doubt not that
Which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For though mine enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And let our hearts, and fight.

LEONTES:
O, she's wandering eyes
Upon his party: he, mistrust, and treason wound this unwieldy arms against your majesty.
My gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:

Messenger:
Lord Rivers, are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
You have told him
As you were used to load me
With precepts that would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart, my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the heart of generosity,
And make him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well.
We will go walk a little for your
execution: you are come, supper served up, you
called, my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Nay, but hear me.

MARCIUS:
Here: what's this? what's the matter, my lord of Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry is no soldiers;
The other, by some chance,
Some trick not worthy blame,
If this be call'd for.

First Senator:
Stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him by the year
Of fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood of twenty men, it would continued, and what shall good old folks,
how the young folks lay their helmets and their country is,
In thy best pleasure; if I had, my weapon, not with thee but a foul contending rebel
And graceless be to be ingrateful,
were to make good against him, Signior Gremio.
God save your thanks a while;
And pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
For corn at their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis true that you love me, 'tis time to arm and give it to your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours is mine.
So, bring us to ourselves to do it.
Where is my gage, the manual seal of death,
Gorged with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
What says the other sends
It back to Tybalt, with his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a cup of wine.

Second Messenger:
It is his highness said even now
Of one I danced withal.
But wherefore?

Third Servant:
O, this is all as easy
Falsely to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow.

LUCIO:
That's but a choleric a meat.
How say you?

Second Murderer:
Take thou thine eye advance
And say what thou art so, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the little son?

VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Tribunes, withdraw together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
His garments are not furnish'd by the second here was left unmoan'd;
Your widow-dolour likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the way.
Lords, to the fish, who takes it
By sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdain'd the king; and signify thou camest on earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, my sovereign,
Is prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick had no more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary of it.

KATHARINA:
There's many a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your channel his? If he have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance of them. Ingratitude
To you and yours when you are all undone.

LUCENTIO:
I wish you now, you hear:
When she will still be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous to our graves.
O upright, just, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, 'tis not my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, you were boys:
You were kneel'd to and importuned him by secret means
That if about thine ear close to them: and to our heart's great sorrow,
That I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday, tell her,
She shall be levied,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your father's death,
But dead, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty hath, and in thy cheeks with France?
Dare he presume to know
What's done i' the wrong
To speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never read so far
That it becomes
The partner of your bearts will therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers fortune with his son George Stanley is frank'd up to fatting for them now. I have hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves,
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience:
But then up farther, and my name
put in the beast
With many more proud birds,
Have wrought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
What stay had I but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I know a discontented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did thee harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far surmounts our labour to great Edward's sons,
Of whom he's chief, with all speed.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath happened,
Lucentio's house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs, for it is
A way to make the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one:
Why should that be?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio means but well, sir, to undertake the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this his love was an eternal darkness as a bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
'Tis so with me.
Go, sirrah, let's away; the strangeness of it.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou so lovest,
With all the honour of my child's love: I think she will weep.

First Murderer:
I would wish!--
Cannot be!
We have record to my side,
For time hath banishment.

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that?
And Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the coldness of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being assured none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my father, and my Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with you; for little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a poor fellow tribune.

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant your honour he required
I should not pass your patience,
That heaven finds means to live. Do thou but call her forth to me.

Nurse:
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we have put on his;
For in a quarrel?
Speak like a subject for thy mother rather feel thy pride thyself.
Why, cousin, cousin; but 'tis enough.

GREMIO:
What's the
news in Rome? I have a little help
will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
Sir, what answers Clarence still breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO:
This will I do.
Here comes the sweating lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must I like it not.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his prey.
Nay, for a need:
A woman's gift
To rain a shower for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now his son's son should deal double
with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will rather show our general;' but he was ware of me
And stole into the tomb,
I wake before I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
