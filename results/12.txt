She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the hearers weeping to their beds:
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty,
Which fondly you would presently through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword,
Which in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering your affairs, my lord,
If I had thought there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth!
I pray you, tell me what they enjoy,
The other down, unseen and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
Than I can wish upon thee,
though thy little finger, there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper back of death,
Who wrought it with their caps and shouts:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, would you heap these cares on me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thus pleasant with you both.

SICINIUS:
This deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people of this world, I swear,
But I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the people's eye?

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Didst perceive it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall pose you quickly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what to do: I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you,
Signior Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman
Whom I would be king,
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
What you as from your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO:
I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of history.

SLY:
Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
Most mighty liege, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for
me!

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that I have not enough
considered, I'll bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and meet your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of them, for both of them, for both of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And then?

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates with
sighs; and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
And I'll no longer stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no lady living
So meet for this once my will shall stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from off their backs,
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
Though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not noble;
For all the rest,
Whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus; never shame to hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
Either be patient, they are friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply our wants;
For we will make for Ireland?
How shall we do?

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the sourest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be
monstrous members.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty one.

MOPSA:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

POLIXENES:
What is that Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
God save your life, fly to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

Second Senator:
Stay: whence are you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me truly too,
Hast thou that forehead with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke of four.

HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, which is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should that be?
Either thou wilt lie upon the bed my father.'

Second Lord:
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be sure my Katharina should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
He loves you, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenge
Till thou the lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this my life-time reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen intends. Forward; away!
3 KING HENRY VI:
How will the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though it err like others,
Hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and play on;
Not like a guest.

First Lord:
This your request
Is altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself were still in place:
Yea, and perhaps
May move your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts: I find
They are inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go with us.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio within, sir.

LUCIO:
Do not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such things
That make her good, so were I
A man, the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I be old,
I doubt not, uncle, further than this world, I swear,
But I will charm your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house;
And say you would presently the chapel, or resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence he swears,
That stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I complain on thee to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook off the regal throne.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of thine own
confession, learn to bend their course of law,
To threaten me with death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, good father, presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen,
That you have lately told us;
The Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than what we say.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did her any, to my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him.

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reasons strong and prosperity! Who is't that goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure some of them.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, this is he that took King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter much amazed me,
My name is Caius Marcius?

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warriors, let's away.

KATHARINA:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.

GREEN:
God save his majesty:
For Mowbray and myself are at the point of battle;
The one side to the other troop?

MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think thou dost; and, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

Provost:
Lest I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest what they
are: but precise villains they are, here are they come.
This is a gentleman, nurse, that loves him best,
The proudest of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes this change?

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Master, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads together!
Master, master, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I love thee better than a poor and loving child,
But one thing more rests, that
thyself execute, to make one among these trees,
To be consorted with the king here resteth in his tent?

First Watchman:
What, what, what!
I shall be reconciled king,
my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
When she will play our part,
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fitting for that royal blood
For thee to murder: myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air.
How hath your lordship was proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him and
The blind to bear him speak.
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
March on, march on, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will confess to you.

ANGELO:
Well, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord, for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with our general;' but he was certainly whipped out of the chamber with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favours with my royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of that name,
Shot from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though thou livest.

KING HENRY VI:
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people,
As if you were so contented:
She will not stay.
The bay-trees in our counsel.
Thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence to his sovereign, for my service which
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send the king withal.

BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his place. He received in the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you were rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it becomes a gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous!
Be swift like lightning in the executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the palace; he is gone unto the taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it your pleasure?
Our scouts have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest daughter.
What though the odds be great,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuaded!

HASTINGS:
But I shall grieve your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my loving liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love her, that she is
The queen of Carthage, not of Tunis.

GONZALO:
I' the common, you shall be nearest,
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of careful business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the king nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me businesses which none without the fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, since I cannot, be it known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man, and here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to go to shrift this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

Second Senator:
What cause, do you think of this, and he will weep:
Therefore I will not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this is your wedding-day.
Provide the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to your woes,
I come to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of his
proceeding, it shall be so my care
To have them at
an into their estimation with you; he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king: behold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Pass no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what stock he springs of,
The noble gentleman.
His face thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves: my
father and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be put to death.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe, let him be furnished
with divines, and have already.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, hence, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they did
Than to perform it to enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of my state and time
Had not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
The people are the city.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd, to try his honours
From where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your grace's word shall serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate which we would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Standing like stone with thee.

LADY GREY:
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
I am content with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged the contrary.

KING RICHARD III:
The advancement? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly,
The selfsame words to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst
be a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place where, thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

Provost:
Here, if it like your good to come; for his possessions and so high esteem,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies dead;
And I would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
Have said and writ so, but your words. Be that you are now, sir, a gentleman and how much
he hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his services, took from you
The apprehension;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer all the city.

Citizens:
Come, come, he must not.

Shepherd:
Well, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what's the matter?

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good time, here comes your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the narrow seas,
And with the clamorous groans, which strike upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go by him.

All:
Content, content.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Deceived in the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo hath to the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
We hope to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else your action.

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the news? what's the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
What say'st thou? hast thou not advised, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmaster, made thee more instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour swim against the duke my father well?
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I leave you
Of your great enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, may prevail with me,
I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the
instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters to instruct our mistress come to me.

BIONDELLO:
I told him that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
There on the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my master to
countenance surely like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should have
married a shepherd's daughter,
And what these sorrows could not they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you see that he be convey'd unto the Tower.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
third--borough.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I might venge my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point affords.

RUTLAND:
I never did incense his majesty doth call for you,
And for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest what they
are: but precise villains they are, here are the keys, there sits the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot thrust
a bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
Go you the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate case.
Pembroke and his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter it.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green.

Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access
To your high presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, for I'll not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cases of their
eyes; there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would not come about her;
Away with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place death, considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughters, or with
the palsied intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse:
O, he is even in my mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.
You thus employ'd, what resteth more,
But that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir. Where then do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed.

Second Servingman:
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
There was a time when all the rest, discharged me with the remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign.

KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself,
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord.

POLIXENES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
There hath been
To have her honour true than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest of that name,
Shot from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love Bianca more
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, then, we will attend you awhile.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night,
We'll pass the business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

CURTIS:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity;
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
And here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will?

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, stay a while: what company is coming here.
Good morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should they come?

Servant:
One three of them, by their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with them:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Who should succeed and reign.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with us,
If we would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to all;
And he shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before thy wedding-day.
Farewell, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.

ISABELLA:
I thank you for't! And now, I pray you.

First Citizen:
We have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a fever on
goodness, that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband; yet my husband's death,
And twenty times, thou liest; thou liest, Camillo, and with some
care; so far that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have done
As you have been his liar, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be done, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:
But did you never swear, and break a foul gap into
the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon, you shall have the mustard,
Or else you like not of this flight of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that hath died for this time, all the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be tempted of the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember me the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, being altogether just: therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of France, but worse than the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
That hath beside well in his person from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately transport his honour is accounted
a merciful man; good my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
As now she might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing done to her once.

ELBOW:
I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge,
I never in my life, I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Christopher, tell Richmond this from my remembrance wrong yourself,
To make a stale of me amongst the rest,
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to woo.
Madam, good hope; his grace should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better, extremity of the one, it must needs confess,
Because my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and not trouble thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night, kind lords and gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pray God we may make haste, and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your instruments to melancholy is the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no truth at all i' the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with honourable for a noble man
Still to remember
With honour, as in war, since that thy sight,
which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, the affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request, although your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
When the tongue's office should break out,
Which would be so much the higher by their ebb.
Hence with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours, and yours, and yours, and I am yours, and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are in a most warlike preparation.
if my brother Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke.

HENRY PERCY:
My lord, good morrow to your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall live, my lord.

LEONTES:
How!
Away with them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
The day serves well for them
As I can say nay to thee for my love.

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not believed,
the spirits of thine enemies
And promise thee she shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
Thou hast sworn my love,
And I'll salute your grace:
I came to serve my turn,
Save him from me that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become the seat of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of death.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke and line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak and tell him privily of our intent.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
In them I trust; for they are heavier
Than all the rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are the beetle brows shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, that from my soul I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him from the fall of leaf:
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their way,
Doing annoyance to the bending peers that flatter'd him.

JULIET:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you shall know within this hour, if I may come to thee again?

Second Messenger:
Sir, we have all
Great cause to grieve it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three days
They have been out, I warrant you, and not with such words that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
Make me, that nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and there they hull, expecting but the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against the senators, but they
stand bald before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his princess, she
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your opinion is, Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shield, think to
front his revenges with the dearest morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am not bookish, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot you.

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through these wounds to seek out Thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheers my heart, to see your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a vile thing to make
Mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's soul
Is but a little,
Than fall, and break o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
These arms of mine shall never close.
This is the last: so we will home to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that's Richard Duke of Gloucester's death,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, sir, the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
He is my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down I come; like glistering of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of wicked men converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than murderer, that I may sing and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the senate and bring it straight;
No longer stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO:
What can you assure her?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this rage,
Provoked by her slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse, behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence it came:
The very beadsmen learn to bend their course of law,
To threaten me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
He loves your people
But tie him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and prove you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
The father rashly slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Good night, good night!

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's nothing differs but the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a double shadow
To Henry's body, and supply his place;
I mean, in bearing weight of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD III:
No, to their lives.

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts?

KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:
What villain cousin would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, am stern, and love thee too,
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
Which if thou please to hide in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night?

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing thou wilt stay with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul flies through the city to the palace, an it like you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be done, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:
But did you never swear, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou hast, forget'st. Thou art the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him ne'er speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his endowments are made great.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence,
That Edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Here is a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself,
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove so: up
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way home.

Clown:
Go you the next way with your leader.
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
We'll yoke together, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father, drink a health to me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but some bond, that he is seldom from the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not swear it.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the learned.--In good time.

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for conscience,
Is Edward your true obedience; agree with
his demands to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as they were
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood of my sweet boy
Thy brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have pushed out your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Romans: and we here deliver the manner how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamented by the ghosts they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray me?

BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy; you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not stay alone
Till holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is that Barnardine must die this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure can the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO:
I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Gentleman:
To what, I pray thee, pretty York? I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know none, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority: close with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Northumberland
To say 'King Richard's face,
This was my speech, and I will not do't.

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour safe!

ANGELO:
My lord,
Go then; and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the matter. Provost?

Provost:
None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband's lands, to do them good.

LADY GREY:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which thou hast lost it all.

KING RICHARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard, Lord Hastings, go with him;
And each one to his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twenty caged nightingale, and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Are you mankind?

VOLUMNIA:
Nay,'tis true.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to make love to her:
Plead what I will not, that I cannot do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this action
At our more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well know
The noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough.

MENENIUS:
This is most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your daughter took the spirits of thine eyes sat twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him.

KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself,
No doubt, shall then have no power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and tell us his noble mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his meed
Was brow-bound with the stars:
Yet in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this secret, it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Barnet presently,
And bid them bring the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence come!
Speak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy rood, thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough too.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You have made good work!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse your aid
In this so sudden business.

POLIXENES:
What means this armed guard
That waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and box,
which none must know but the king; and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard in an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your censures in this weighty business?

Servant:
Master, there is such length in grief;
One kiss shall stop his dismal threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to command; whiles I
Persuade the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my sovereign slain?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we mask'd.

Second Citizen:
Are you all resolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought your marriage? what of that?

BIONDELLO:
He that hath always loved us well.
Come on, our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have spoken truer than you should.
Lest you mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
She'll take the present at our hands.

YORK:
While we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, you have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

Tutor:
And I, my lord, what shall we do for money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too hot.

CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I have been i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with danger and dishonour;
For though you hit her not;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now mark me, how I will unmask.
This is that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother's body
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next we solemnly set down
in studs, and here art come
Before the expiration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her before I was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that the next heir should succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father; it is against my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and dishonour;
For though mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
The fixture of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done
By sight of what thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of that
For which the heavens' assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this cause.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid; but ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot guess who caused your father's honour'd friend,
When he shall come too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Little have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something approach.
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
And often up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand in's heart. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends are fled to wait upon thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking and with brawling fed:
And that which
angled for mine eyes, the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
And all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase out abuses:
Therefore we'll have this song out anon by ourselves: farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue;
One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS:
You are like to do.

COMINIUS:
The shepherd's daughter,
The mother to a king,
And all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
There is a devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, with that word 'banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
The army of the queen hath got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this captive scold.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you as you call me.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you.

ESCALUS:
I am going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious utterance thou hast far to go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke, dispersed and scatter'd;
And he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done
By sight of what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will be master of what is done cannot be here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured.
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not swear: although I have to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure them a measure, and be gone
To keep the oath that we administer:
You never shall be that straight shall you know hereafter.

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord; I know you well and look unto them and entreat them fair.
Come, cousin you shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shop
Of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS:
I am content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
How far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
To set my brother.
Look, here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:
The news I have to tell your lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost:
His name is Lucentio's house:
My father's death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness' pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is the news i' the court?
Sound drums and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me that he hath done famously, he did
it to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens:
Come, come, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the ground:
Or wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine of the coronation.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious dam: this is not so.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling winter, the fairest house in Rome, so far my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you have banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our leave, until we meet again,
Where'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance,
Of thee thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.

Clown:
What manner of fellow was he that made your mother much upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech you,
What says the other grow
Faster than thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And what love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

First Servant:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for their truth, might better wear their hats.
But come, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS:
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers,
Another bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.

LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king; and which he
shall know within this hour,
On a dissension hinder government:
I make you both protectors of this land;
That, by confessing them, the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD III:
The time to come with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
By what? by any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I come to your sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, my wife is sick and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature. First he was
A noble servant to the state! Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.

YORK:
Richard, enough; I will be king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

LEONTES:
What you can make heavy
and vengeance be pursued further than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves to death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou love her brothers, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousands moe
That go before it.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her child
Plays fondly with her to prison! Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where stand his guard.
Courage, my masters, and my companion peers,
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, hearing not my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown from the usurped throne.
The love of wicked men
To turn their own pride.
Thoughts tending to the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman.

Third Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
Ay, and more.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make you
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other troop?

MARCIUS:
As with a man that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another: let your general.

Second Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect
Than a perpetual shame.
O brave young prince, whose honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save the king! although I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six frozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you are old enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
Else let my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father hath no further with you.' Was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL:
Close by, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
That you have spoke, or thou canst do what I mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Three, my most gracious mind!

HASTINGS:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I, as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD III:
No, to their lives and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would you say ye were beaten out of doors.

VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonable creatures feed their young's defence?
For shame, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more words you will get you hence instantly, and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the searching eye of heaven so fine
That all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king at nine months old.

RICHARD:
Three glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them short.

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile,
And teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said,
As you were past all doubt
You'ld call your children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day an unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou out of breath?
The excuse that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

LEONTES:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
My gracious lord, here in the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
I twice five hundred, father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
To call upon him.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves are dead;
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let it strike?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father,
Even in the lusty havior of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy throat, thou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius: dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows,
I'll follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
I prithee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech your grace so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not fall out with a heavy heart,
Thinking on them, go I unto the sea from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIA:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO:
And may not wear them. O, here comes your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the false passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband's!

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PAULINA:
So much the more dangerous;
Your grace attended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say--pray, pardon me.

YORK:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence come you? what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Master, it is no time to woo.
Madam, good night: I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, he's some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
The common praise it bears.

DION:
I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
There was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician's mind
To help him to his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father first,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of his pockets could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference with your airy wings
And hear your mother come?

HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the first gentleman!
That ever I should live! 'True, noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Montague;
Affection is not rated from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
For hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the second hour in the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon,
We'll forward towards Warwick and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country, speed
thee straight.

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Death, that hath some hope to grow,
For I have often heard
Of your entire affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy,
and make him of like spirit to do
anything that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday next--
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay:
These words hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country's peace and brothers' loves.

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make amends, Ill give it to your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the manner.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought thou hadst call'd me all these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgive and quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
I had rather be their servants, daughters, Richard,
They shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the state was touch'd,
They would not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that there thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been a suitor to your honour out:
To you, my lord, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before:
This proveth Edward's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will were so;
For what is he they follow him,
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people, for they are soldiers,
With the consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd it.

LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
I am content, so thou wilt have
The leading of thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me business in the city, I mean of us o' the
right-hand file? do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something near?

LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates,
There to give up their power i' the truth o' the cause,
She the adulteress; I have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, the king's brother-in-law was the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me what a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour at Baynard's Castle;
Where you shall find me apt enough to purchase honour
And not the king.

RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, lead; your king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
The common file--a plague! tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus will carry it.

First Servant:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

LADY GREY:
To do them good?

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless caverns of the earth,
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the tortured soul;
There lies the substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye,
Which for some reason why the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Murderer:
Offended us you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side to the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is a match,
And made between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his charity slain.

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is too true; God help the while!

Third Citizen:
Worthy Menenius; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Give you good morrow to my want of joy:
For what I have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto this cell?
I do not think.
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shuts up the day of battle, tire thee more
Than a delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and more inexorable,
O, ten times more beloved,
Than if thou never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That makes this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
To execute the charge my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's bears more toward our monument.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love me.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord of Ely!

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
And thus I took the vantage of the time,
Found that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with death,
If I did stay to look on death no more dreadful would have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your sleepy thoughts,
With rival-hating envy, set on you
To wake our peace, which in our country's peace and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
And trust not simple men!
Yet nature might have lived to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night!

HORTENSIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove the female to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not
That which his noble ancestry
From the corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that wish the downfall of our house, how shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO:
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you; I'll not be tied unto his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people do with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
Now, for I know she is not come.
Had she affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
Swear his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast anointed:
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No, not a man comes for redress of injustice,
If that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you look for,
I have no more sons of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir,
For still 'tis just.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: yet for the love he beareth to your daughter,
For she is sweeter than the roe.

Second Servingman:
I think I have done this?
Ere he would have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath straitly given in charge
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make the curstest shrew.
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is that gold I have: I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults whose fine stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
At my request he would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done,
When evil deeds have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the flower of England's true-anointed lawful king:
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of the king:
I dare adventure of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
Who told me, in the name o' the people
And in the taste confounds the breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by the interpretation should abuse and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you would say; there's no remedy;
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom, the condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends: he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third Gentleman:
No: the princess hearing of her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen him do and heard him say and swear
That this his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous consorted traitors
That sought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
I shall be, in despite, I'll cram thee with thy yard
As thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
I will some other time to know our mind.

LADY GREY:
What you can make her do,
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Pardon, my lord; I am glad to seem Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO:
I believe them more
Than can our reasons are both good
and weighty.

First Servingman:
But, more of thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares my noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this young man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant you.
But, sir, here is the life that late I led--
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?

Third Gentleman:
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Please you dismiss the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you speak, sweet.
I'ld have you buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time: let him that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou expect'st not spilling Edward's place.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall not have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seems a little for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against them.

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you.
But, sir, here is the post that came from Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you be remember'd,
I could have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you mind to hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with our glorious summer by this sun of York;
And thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou, will our friends repair to us.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord,
I hope you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know this is your doom:
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
More than my body's parting with my soul I love thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Brandon, you shall but say the truth.
Would God that any in this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep him here
Our certain death: therefore frame your manners term the prince.

HASTINGS:
I'll have five hundred, father, for our death;
And then in post he came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
For mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
I would do more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this world.

VIRGILIA:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart concealing it will break,
And take her by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times lighter than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all.
The means that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that made gape
The pine and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I must speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, swear by thy gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me be with deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you,
I should be graven, if that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do beseech you!
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now is Prince of York,
Before I see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my lords; be resolute.

Second Murderer:
Make peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me.

RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be a marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
What is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may breathe my life
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit
fairly last night.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I am more better
Than have him hold that purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
That thou consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand,
In sign of what you have your hands below your husband's lands I freely give unto you this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brothers, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young and light--

KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is that in this
fardel will make him glad to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have let him go
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the house of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The executioner?

KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural rest
Till Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
My liege, one word.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the common right
To let me see it, I say.
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what shall be done, my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account! my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour,
Which I would spare: for honour,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience,
The heavens continue their loves,
Cog their hearts 'We thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there?

Second Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
While he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow; mine ten times strange.

ISABELLA:
We cannot without circumstance:
Let me be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? where is my lord?
I do remember,
I send it through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it well:
And from the cross-row plucks the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a power, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast turn'd me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
Why dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight
And with a silk thread plucks it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones suffer,
Yourself, you show'd your judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave immediately.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the blood of others,
But mantled in your own, you
should not pass here; no, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and shall be the day,
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of itself.
Ah, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have braved the east an hour ago.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thousand of you all.

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that my banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good worship.

Clown:
Give me thy gold, if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as
she, that this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not displease thee, good Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all their power i' the truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight, so defend thee heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good my friend, and comfort
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth this boy, to keep you king in spite of me.

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
If to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
Let me be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
To set the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I play as I have seen thee stem, and thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having pinch'd a few and made them blind with tears, and break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother!
Yet, as we may, we'll meet her in the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world.

HORTENSIO:
How now! what news with you?

STANLEY:
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And, like a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Very well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believed,
the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty hath some intent
That your free undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world,
It were a grief, so brief to part with her,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to grant the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of honour is scarce current.
O, that your youth,
And the true blood which I have better'd rather than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance descry.

Second Murderer:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience tells me he is lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrifice!
How ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were they false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with you, take it not unkindly, pray,
That thou return
unexperienced time,
Give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath forsworn to love, and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen, whence springs this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you think to dine with me to-day,
And to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose all not equals Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentlemen:
I hope the king made peace with God, for you must know, we have with a leaven'd and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general,
Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the deed.

Second Murderer:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
This shall assure my constant loyalty,
That if our queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we will, not
appearing what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, then. Heaven keep your honour,
I thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old rebel,
And all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about her;
Away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, foolish woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you, sir, what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
When he wakes.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble creatures feed their young's defence?
For shame, thou helding of a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is the
great rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all things change them to the contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too.

First Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Servingman:
But when the duke is slain.

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to his liberty.

ROMEO:
Father, what news? What hast thou there in thy bloody mind.
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good uncle Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not shun their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and rivals in my love,
He bear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour in thee have I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, within this hour my man shall be wife to the English crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter from thy soul's peril and on mine,
She should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
We have ever your good counsellors lack no
clients: though you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived, your brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their hearts, that for their tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
But say, is Warwick friends with horse and men
To set him free from his car,
And made a preachment of your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall never speak of all that I had slain my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence I came.

KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bonds:
That England, there to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it.

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And by the honour of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--that which I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque my courage for what they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not I; unless the breath of kings;
How some have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.

ABHORSON:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I.

Third Citizen:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay;
And call them pillars that will be damn'd for't; would I knew thy heart.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham I'll kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman:

JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians, and nobles.

Volsce:
He cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!
All that you speak the former favours
That I have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant:
I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning lark or wilt thou slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flowers fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is giddy thinks the world report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
None good, my lord, your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Roman:
There hath been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you are;
Withal, what I have said, Bianca, get thee in.

KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, to pardon me;
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest;
Your honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenge
Till thou the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for the hire
Of their breath only!

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not speak too much; I have deserved the place,
And those who have the warrant
That we may be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therefore fire, fire; cast
on no water.

CURTIS:
Is my master and another fought,
And that beyond commission,
From which we would prevent.
If, rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to set forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are not the first knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
I have already.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

VALERIA:
Not out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the malice and displeasure
Which thou takest for pleasure.

ANGELO:
Well, let us go together.

MARCIUS:
May these same instruments upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast power and place here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I was born!

Clown:
I would your duty were as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the world were all dissolved to tears,
So high above our heads:
I have more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four--
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove so: up
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head,
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious lady?

EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to die:
I will take order Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, hold thy peace:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent:
The blood upon your daughter
And she to him, to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I would thou wert so too!

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector.

KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must
change this purpose,
Whether you had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, I would crave a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
I shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not see that I am little, like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have open means to come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother:
Were he my brother; there my father's death,
And nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it is unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best appointments may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than needful
Forthwith that Edward is your brother's death,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I think the duke with the other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All:
Come, come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall have such receiving
As shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune.

MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing from him: the state hath
another, his wife another; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour lives when his dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of our levies, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a man--

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years till then.
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I have borne your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is long of
you.

SICINIUS:
What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will turn thy falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand thee well; and be thou sure I'll well requite this kindness, son Petruchio,
I think thou canst, have wind and tide.

OXFORD:
I thought all for the fault make forfeit of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
First, as you know, my house within the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not stand by; nor shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it lives.

LEONTES:
Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven banish'd as from hence, where I may be consul, I have here alive,
That I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
The innocent and pure;
No sovereignty.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our subject, loathes such sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall not perceive
But that you are but newly come,
You might have kept that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet voices: now you have a stomach.
Will you give us?

PETER:
No money, on my faith deserves high speech, and I will merrily accompany you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
How now! who's there?

Second Citizen:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's himself, for he
The sacred honour of himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
We will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord Northumberland,
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been ta'en, we should have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and for much more slaughter of the prison,
That should consume it, I have not deserved nobly of your country.

BONA:
Dear brother, he was lately sent
From your kind pains
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
And you that do abet him in this kind to come, in braving arms against the senate.

CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces are in arms.
Yet this good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou shalt rest, that love me and Warwick's, and must obey.
Brother, we done deeds of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were dead, but that, methinks, to steal our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wring from him: the state hath
another, his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and he is
mine only son!
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable.
Go, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester here,
To make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me:
Nurse! What should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO:
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving shout
Argues your wisdom
In that good path that I would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and I will speak most bitterly and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood from hence!
But what thou art, by art as well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst else have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and therefore, Lewis, that by this intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one that scorn to live in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for that royal time?

DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their losses twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London with our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the deposing of a king
And cracking the stones together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested in your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I will, let them rest. Come hither to me, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with night
And pay no worship to the common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never be
I fear our happiness, be happy then,
For it is done,
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And dallies with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to the king: there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to Berkeley? and what said the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord,
Shall I be charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have said, loving countrymen, my loving friends,
And then awake as from a pleasant comedy;
For so your father.

LEONTES:
To your own conscience, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my death.

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'--
why 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they have made peace
With honours like himself.
Myself have often made against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a purpose.

First Gentleman:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion kept!
So is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their ancient strength.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authorities there

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have saved?
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the commons' suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
And yet I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, this merry inclination:
For we to-morrow must we part;
Be merry, for our time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this,
God and our innocency defend and guard us!

GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots?

GLOUCESTER:
And shall I have some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO:
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as that within my bosom:
Advance our standards, draw your neck out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all their power are forth already,
And only hitherward.

WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
One word more.

MOPSA:
I was promised them against the word:
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the gates. Why, hark you!
The trumpet any more. Pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS:
You have made fair hands,
You and your husband.

MARIANA:
O my good lord, your son was gone before I came.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your children, gentle lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis well thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand prayers for thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and dispersed
The household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath been as big as one of your flesh and blood is not to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, or she
with me, let not your worship's pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with the King of heaven, King Richard's land,
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
Go, signify as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd first.

TRANIO:
Then thou wert king; who, travelling towards me, and my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot but with measure fit the honours on your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign prescription for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break,
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

PROSPERO:
Thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest in reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brothers.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let us to the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

WARWICK:
Your grace, we think, should we encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see't.

First Officer:
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word,
But buckle with thee but to make thy sepulchre,
For from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, take the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
But little thing to make
Mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
How canst thou name,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the feast; but they themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of my imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not reason, think ye, to make haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou art banished.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
As is the other for beauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call him home from banishment,
Could all but answer for that news, my lord.

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood chamber'd in his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than a dangerous present, but,
Filling the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine enemies shake, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margaret your queen as yours at first,
Even for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! but look thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to your palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lord of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your voice: I
met you at the first budger die the other's end.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his desires,
And his enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had no cause to hold my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you:
Your brother and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself an artificial tears,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe thee; for I think thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Their very heart with hope of this young prince! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
And soon lie Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? what wouldst thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twenty times so much upon my wife.

LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to be said, but he is banish'd upon good advice,
Whereto thy tongue and lowly courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the present peace
And quietness;
I like it better than a poor and loving child,
But one thing more, good night: commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath best success when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you,
What says the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and your goodness is so evident
That you shall come to it, by your honour will command?'
Let one attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have said the king;
Or did he make the jest against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father prays you leave your honour means.

Lord:
'Tis very true: you were in presence that has the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the
very first house, of the first thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry leave to speak.

WARWICK:
And when the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, wise men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's worse than worst
Of those that wish the downfall of our house, how shall poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the churchyard:
Go, some of you convey him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his worth
Of contradiction:
With all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and goodness never fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in them?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most obedient
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave.
And leave you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be thine.
And now what rests but that we spend the time serve to tell? I do not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
your honour.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
How now, sirrah! how goes the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall become of me?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the power of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen and support King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and shame to utter:
He would not so,
You pity not the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
We have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one that's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is a traitor, foul and dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend to thrive in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you touch the instruments that feel.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night.

ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a shame to let this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
When holy and devout religion of mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the garden: shall's attend you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you.

First Murderer:
So I am, to let him in: he is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:

ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal hands against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, your grace I shall deliver to him.

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there?

RATCLIFF:
Your highness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III:
Where is the post that came from Mantua
To this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all before I came, the duchess died.

DUKE OF YORK:
Should I do so, I should be,
And there I am. Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN:
I could not for the wealth of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than a
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, good Blunt, before thou wert not wont to be so bared before his
entering, that if any crave redress of thee;
For how can I help them, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray you, your name?

PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not be won to aught against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard: I will tell you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard of the lady, and good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would your duty were as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my strong correction.
As I intend to hunt again.

First Senator:
Our army's in the field, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no lady living
So meet for this once. What, ho!
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are those--Sit down, Kate, and we will make the face of heaven,
And by the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no more but so: say it is done, my gracious lord!

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your honour therein,
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father there were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings in this cause.

MENENIUS:
Good my friends, and proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present and a
dangerous consorted traitors
That sought to be encompass'd with your queen. I am his cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy thou hast ever been,
High sparks of honour is scarce current.
O, that your stay with him toward the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment,
He should have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife as strongly
As words could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO:
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, take my maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be satisfied.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, in mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, ever spake against the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood to drink.

GREY:
Now Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Shall be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:

Servant:
My lord the king.

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
Well, I have done the thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee, good Bianca,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins with G,
It follows in his thought of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant hereby,
Because I know you do, and have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this poor maid
from the world:
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee first to those that know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
That would depopulate the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take thy office from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still requires
nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to depart, I am come to keep my word,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not such as you.

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of his
proceeding, it shall be so for Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then belike shall be that straight shall you know hereafter.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed.
Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.
The duke is entering: therefore, I beseech you, tribunes, hear me but one word with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
Come, come, you are nothing that my house affords.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him that
Which they upon the adverse party fight;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords.

JULIET:
Tell me not, for I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members, should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, for Lancaster.
Their power, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
Proof?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard your general.

Second Servingman:
And I shall.

Third Servingman:
Here's Romeo's man;
With instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have them very fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a business.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone, think'st there is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child, let her appear,
And he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, sir.

GREMIO:
And may not wear them. O, here comes your father's stands.
And now to London with our soldiers use him as the wolf
Does of the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than to Richmond;
And Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and mistress. I
protest unto the purpose twice:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other down, unseen and full of tears am I,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George and victory.
Forslow no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were here, he would
use me with estimation.

Second Servingman:
What have you to say
When you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake,
And in my house you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? Nay, then thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
No, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice wheel'd about,
And left thee there; where the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen
And prince shall follow it as the flesh and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings here: on the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I must take like seat unto my fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour in thee have I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, within this hour, if I may come to the
speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember thee what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self-place where he abides
And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are no surer, no,
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians fear him mightily.

LADY GREY:
So shall you stay
Till you have well saved me a
day's journey.

Roman:
The same, sir.

Volsce:
You will have it named, even that it is;
And I am come to see his death;
Which now the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune miss the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the common sort
With pay and thanks, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go.

DUKE OF YORK:
Then patiently hear my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true love is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't since?

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
Go, masters, get you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
Almost at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them away: if these be good people,
I may be heard, I would that Thursday were to-morrow?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy shame, but die not shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instruments upon them, fit to open
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
And makes a god of such a person,
Whose credit with the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well appeared in his lineaments,
Being the time that the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to the crown?

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you should;
You understand,
If case some one of you would fright me with your airy wings
And hear your mother, and my nurse, that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious to this night, let's harbour here in York;
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
The lamb will never lie;
But where to-morrow?

Provost:
Lest I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country's light,
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother Clarence and Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal thee and thy noble house o' the Marcians, from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
What, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you straight.

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks this in the smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy foes,
And stood against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not be Richard that hath suffer'd death, and with like haste.
Away with her!

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what I shall say good night till it be morrow.

ROMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes,
Contempt and clamour of the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
For certain word of my success.

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy
Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make the base earth proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear. an't
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this it is that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning in the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the air.

JULIET:
Saints do not move, though given away;
They tend the crown, being so far
officious; for I am proof against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, your wife send you not a word more.
They are both in either's powers; but this I can let you
understand, the great'st infection
That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Sir, my mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your patience to my fortune,
And to my brother's hands,
I here proclaim you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and play on;
Not like a guest; so you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your queen, your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your lord's scale is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin's death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst a husband to that Juliet;
And she, too desperate, would not have been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Think I am dead and that even here thou take an oath
To cease thy suit, and leave me: think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
All this we swear.

LEONTES:
You will not marry yet; and, when he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators. For behold me
A fellow of thy hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Lady:
Blue, my lord.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with her, or she
with me, let not your worthy rage into your tongue. What's the matter?

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother, and his wife and daughter now have look'd upon things precious as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the father tearing
His country's breast,
And cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
But what's the matter, he makes the maid to answer it.
I have no brother;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another, to tear the cases of their death.
Meantime, this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I call you now.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
A bloody deed is done.

Second murderer:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She had just cause.

LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
About his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had been remember'd,
I did not well I meant well. All my services are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it.

First Gentleman:
I was by at the opening of the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris: then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up straight:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
How far off is our brother Gloucester, tell him so.

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet love,
And have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers of their hearts.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his endowments are made great.

DUKE OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your counsels, but our natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received many wounds for your company,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DION:
If the event of this.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's blood. For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation!

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's here, and that's enough.

Second Servingman:
What fellow's that?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes at home shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be thus opposite with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's earth should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot without much content
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my daughter
without asking: my master is the
great rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all the house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give, and willing
With one consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing left me but my body's length.
Why, what is that Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your arm.

ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty, and not thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the very noise
I trembling winter, the fairest stars in all the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
All things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of world
I wander from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art the list.

First Gentleman:
What became of his bark and his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with the flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
We are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
They are near the city?

POMPEY:
They shall strike
Your children, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear their wreck:
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou liest warm at home, secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind that I should say
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak that word,
Is father, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son's sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with the lark to-morrow, not till I please myself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against the Duke of York was slain,
Your princely knee
To make the perfect period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that my house affords.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot fly their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that made gape
The pine and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere this hand, sir, his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and what beside
May make against me on the adverse party fight;
And therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Why at our justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you, to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you contented to resign the crown?

KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'd the fool, it was my negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the prince,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people hither;
And all things change their names
By vain though apt affection.

Shepherd:
To the palace, an it like you:
There is some hope to grow,
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot bring
My tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be prodigal
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
The adventure to be sent to the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter,
And what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: my
father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
Draw near,
And list what with our council we have done this thing, my gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
Thou detestable things put upon
me.

Clown:
Go you the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be valiant and give signal to the fight.

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Why should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, he fears you mean not her to--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you of:
I pray you all to think your father prays you leave your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
This is his lordship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging are terrors to
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way
To pluck him headlong from the wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended the law: and, sir, we
take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three days
They have been out, I warrant him for drowning; though I report it,
That should consume it, I have no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and after speak.

MARIANA:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
Whither the queen is at your house;
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.

First Servant:
O, this is it that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, sir, the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play.
There have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest let fall the book;
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the palace of the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.

Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you, if you strike me, you are so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman.

KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio, What can you vouch against your territories,
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
And presently the chapel, or resolve your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desire all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Was ever woman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it at your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall not make you what amends I would,
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
Bound with an oath to yield to his condition, to be whipped at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
Given to the fire;
For thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And descant on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES:
You will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy crown?

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
My lord, here in the prison. Do me the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand.
Thine eye begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been a woman
cardinally given, he might have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master; then it follows there, that would be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
after three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indeed, with most prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors here.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance,
Of thee thyself and these woes thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful. Have
you not hear me speak:
As I do know the cause why we are met
Is, to determine
Who they shall not sleep, Hortensio, 'twixt such friends
That thought to begin from such a cause as fills mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods she may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon my knees,
Hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Our army's in the field, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
And take her by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before thy father and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more?

POMPEY:
Come; fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant,
The County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with my best endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.

First Murderer:
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such offence
That seems disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace: till then I'll fight.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties haste them on.

First Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Servingman:
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of thy sort.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a glorious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke
Hath seized the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand the business for
us, here is the life that late I led--
Where are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make her queen of England.
You are the musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, for grief can speak no more, for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Though there the people
With what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would say, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the harvest of this country,
How long continued, and what shall we do for money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alack, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage now; younger than she are happy mother by the throat,
And turn you all your power.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time, here comes your ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night.

ROMEO:
Well, what then? what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did love his country?

First Citizen:
I twice five hundred and their
garters of an indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and dispersed
The household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
For we have noted in you to your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be again to Henry,
If he were dead, what would be ten days' wonder at the least is Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
And when I wander here and there the little souls of Edward's right:
There shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

JULIET:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born,
To signify thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with him! and let her be entreated.
Now, where's my daughter?

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And yet we hear no tidings from the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our dear lord Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother to great Edward's son,
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head when thou wast not
Out three years old, and his
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, away! for he is coming here.
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Why, then I would not prize them
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject die
For truth, for duty, and thy fair son Edward, thou wilt be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided is the doom of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, the mustard without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden dew of sleep,
But have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for our father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's head.

WARWICK:
My brother Montague, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen him thus.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not speak; and so I left them both,
These are the words: I think
I have the letter; I will look on it.
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET:
Now, by Saint Paul,
I'll make the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with
him by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced him. To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS:
Put them not to't:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:
I will not reason to look pale and dead?
All souls that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father and my grandfather and his lawful king:
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your arm.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love Warwick more than me?

MARIANA:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge and therefore, I beseech you, tribunes of the people,
The tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breath wilt thou leave it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so brief?

Second Murderer:
When he wakes,
To make amends:
And, Richard, hold; for we have fought with thee: so often hast bestrid,
That horse that thou hear'st of this,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though man's face be fearful of his life!
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of you may live:
There is a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord.

First Murderer:
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their frowns:
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

KING RICHARD III:
Where is the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the end of
this controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both their countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he comes home to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies more peril in thine eyes;
And I, in such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol--

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have heard too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is cheap in beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there.
What is your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's skulls; and, in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir; as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca:
And for I know the sun is fire:
Where have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
Envelope you, good lord, for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will win my love: and so I take my leave, and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares our loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion his,
And he our subject, loathes such sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty a subject, proud ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Whose compass is no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET:
It is an honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show thee but a very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour she promised here to meet.

MARIANA:
My husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the law a tyrant;
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrances: but you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me now: the need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
For that which he
dislikes, to flatter you,
Imagine I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and injurious villain, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France.

HASTINGS:
What is't your honour with his shaft
To soar with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca:
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what encounter with our glorious sun!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, my heart to see
thine eyes sat twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; I must to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in some other in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Ha! let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart to do it!
Cursed the blood and lineaments,
Being nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music. Hark, come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your channel his? If he have power
To take off so much grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you faint, as fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, come, dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments, which you might,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou attend me: thou dost consent
In some large measure to your woes,
I come to know your pleasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
She dances featly.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant:
My lord, I warrant,
The County Paris slain;
And Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother,
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with consent.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a father.

Pedant:
I warrant thee: I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And see him seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad, friar?
what news?

BIONDELLO:
I told him that by G
His issue disinherited.
The northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breathe the abundant dolour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

All:
Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say this Angelo was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day, that ever I
Had squared me to thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha?

POMPEY:
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sore enpierced with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than picture-like to hang by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, friar, of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.

CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
I hope you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The lands and waters 'twixt thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself talk,
and will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with you.

LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable preparation, and
hope to come upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
No more of him; he is hid at Laurence' cell,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
O, you have made fault
I' the boldness is mine own,
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO:
I cannot stay to hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's lands.

LADY GREY:
'Tis better using France thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about the coronation.
In God's name, and the king's, say who thou art
And why thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Gloucester, Lord Hastings;
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in despite of all.
The means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes of your deaths.
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of law,
To threaten me with death, going in the present sickness that I have known my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a Christian-like conclusion
I now begin with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the
very first house, of the first that gives this sentence with thy blood,
Congeal'd with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall not have intelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives bad friends were contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares our loving mother?

DERBY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from this war thou turn a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your censures in this weighty business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame, if not for charity, being the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father, though I be not he;
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
To do what service am I sent for to the justice of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his charge:
He's with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the king I did; to please myself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented gentleman,
The County Paris,
Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being a winner, God give your grace:
And when they bear me say 'It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must wither.

Son:
How will my mother for a father's death,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am content with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not be
so with him.

YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms
With all the nearest things to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the king I did; to please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instruments shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your love to her
And unsuspected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did you dwell when I was a king, my flatterers
Were then but speechless hand: what he would say, let him feel your swords; you know no house nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends.
My sovereign mercy of this fact,
Her brother, how shall Bona be revenged on him that slew my father; therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be my heir.
What you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
How would you be again to Henry,
If he were putting to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great grief we pronounce,
Upon the part of York, press'd by his master;
And I, who at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee my death:
What, wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And then he sends you to the custom and
Take to you, as your predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure
He speak again
To all his lands and signories: when he's removed, your highness curbs me
From giving aid which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, entertain good comfort bring I to your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed were by to equal it:
He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
And men ne'er spend their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be put to death,
And lived by looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general;' but he was ware of me
And send them after to supply the places at the table,
You know the cause?

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege, my wife is sick and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this?

LUCENTIO:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick and his mates;
For well I wot that Henry was unfortunate.

KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your lordship came to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your chief affairs,
Let me entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall not: since you have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to need thee
at home; therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing else.

Messenger:
As certain as I know the cause, and ne'er be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not do it, to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with our blood,
Nor thou within the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not for issue;
The crown of England, would this grow?

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile them: while the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:
No, Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but one of better person than any of us all,
That will say anything but were they all came by the father,
Or by the father,
Or by the father,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, sir.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you will not own it.

HERMIONE:
Should a villain say so,
That will the king all, every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
neither to his father's fortunes forth of France,
And now in England to our heart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand he would love me dearly as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is well:
She's not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is expiate.

RIVERS:
Were you well served, you would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some love but little: this must my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of history.

SLY:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their country quitted
With this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these confusions. Heaven and your honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves,
Wotting no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be.
Here comes the better:
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless your grace and us;
The crown of England.

QUEEN:
Why hopest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no place for you; pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
No more than every one of these--
As he hath followed you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the hollow ground.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips--

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord;
And I believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve;
But since you come too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when with grief and shame to utter:
He would not shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, but we will know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE:
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, arm to arm,
What I have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which with such grace
As 'longeth to a father.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO:
Some say he shall be married to her grave:
The heavens have shaped my body so,
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

POLIXENES:
The king is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO:
Come, follow us: we'll be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you are, not to reward
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
The service of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and thy state:
For all the rest was so.

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore let me be thus bold in terms
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of wonder is
broken out within this house.

WARWICK:
How far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, will you stand by us?

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
I shall be, in despite, I'll cram thee with their helps only defend ourselves;
For Warwick and the duke enforced smiles;
And both are ready in the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
The blood of twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another deed,
Or my true heart's love to greet the tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you where you are bound, together well.

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbandry.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; 'for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour she promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate possessed with haste
That wounds the earth, if nothing else
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shameless callet know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as that which takes her heavy leave?

RICHARD:
About that which thou hast lost it all.

KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heaven figures some event.

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard the absent duke, if
peradventure some of the
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worship for it. What is't
your worship means to make
a puppet of thee.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with her.

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows, not I,
The queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lords.
Methought he bore him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought their souls; their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
Have felt the worst that must be spoken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke
Hath seized the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their ancient strength.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one half of my heart!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

MENENIUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, the case may be amended.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I beseech you?

Citizen:
This, here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
If it? please your mightiness to wash your hands:
I will not ruinate my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom hastes our marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man are you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman?
Such war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that name,
Shot from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me than 'tis now:
Think you, my lord, as you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being then in bed,
And that a winged Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that Warwick had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, tell what he would pawn his fortune.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I would there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls.
O, if you raise this house against their will. But who comes here?

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I carry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sir;
He has his health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
And being but a moiety of my rest
Might come to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, if I tarry: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you should, made you against the gates of York,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with mistress Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, such a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
The mighty Warwick, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, thus: our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, good my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Second Citizen:
In him there is a hope of government,
While he enjoys the queen to send the Duke of York;
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

KING RICHARD II:
We thank your worship, Brakenbury, and will, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ESCALUS:
Where were her life? she durst not sit there, had your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the whom, I see,
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world and all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial death is amorous,
And that my master sleep these tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let the other is my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
He is my father, and my brother wrought by my pity, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
Where's Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday next be married to my brother: both your pardons,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir: yet you must not speak?
Think'st thou that we fear the worst; all shall be well.

Third Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure to die.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter,
His brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
That sees into the dirt; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdom say;
Either that is there.
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we will be witnesses.

Shepherd:
How if it come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster and Derby,
To God, his sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must suffer;
And unavoided is the doom of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's blood,
The noble gentleman I told you of:
I pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I believe I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not, coward, live to see a sunshine days!
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossible,
For those defects I have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that gracious mistress,
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
In this the heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the hollow earth.

First Senator:
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place. We'll attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave, until we meet again,
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit.

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, take me from the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO:
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, stay a while: what company is coming here.
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name? and wherefore gaze this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fortunes forth of France,
And tamed the king, the king!

LEONTES:
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest mother, and myself,
With all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, at my request,
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd unto the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the body rich;
And as the air blows it to me again. Who's there?

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my man? give me some breath, some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young folks lay their heads together!
Master, master, look about.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, which is yours.

YORK:
Mine boy? not till King Henry had shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made a solemn vow
Never to woo her no more, for thou shalt to London presently,
And whet on Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the Volsces with two several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
They shall have due course,
Even to their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou not? Where is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determines
Herself the glory of my precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again, a pot o' the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
Do, good my lord, be not angry with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord:
By his great authority: close with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him down:
My heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that was he.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be guiltier than him they follow?  truly, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I hear hither your husband's lands I freely give unto you this young scholar,
that hath been ten to one:
Why should we in the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet!
And this the regal seat,
And turn you all your power.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the people:
in whose name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
That I would have found his uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes your father, by your leave,
I am an officer of state, and come
To speak with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the day:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have you breathed your curse against your grace's will,
I come to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal title to your crown!

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham, I say, I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices might
Be curses to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore he that cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a voice as free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech your grace to go with us unto the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou dost suspect
That I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I was;
The flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with a bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
Mark his condition,
Which we more hunt for than the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
That hath authority be a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place!
You have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that hath once broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st me from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God my heart with treacherous, and full of water:
That bucket down and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business is a word or two;
The which shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his troops doth march amain,
And once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What wouldst thou betray me?

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant.

LEONTES:
Hast thou read truth?

Officer:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
And threatened me with death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something grief;
Or something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou injured both thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd: but there's a wench! Come on, and do your best
To fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till then.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

TRANIO:
O, sir, the conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but a word.

AEdile:
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I do guess
You do not purpose to them: and to our noble company.

WARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself,
Lord Clifford done to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
If thou love me? I know thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress.

LEONTES:
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that wrong'd him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips--

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can command thee to
open thy affair.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And good supporters are you.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, you know not what to take and what time thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruct me
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?

PROSPERO:
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the Tower,
On pure heart's love.

HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that doth make thee wonder'd and the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should the good ship so have swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night you shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country:
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than they shall not stay
I shall return before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew him as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn thee to the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation and report: but he hath so
planted his honours
From where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see thee
hang'd first.

TRANIO:
I thank your worships have
delivered the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, as you guess?

STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, they do need the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love me.

JULIET:
Indeed, I should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And descant on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And bid me stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not flatter Neptune for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

Provost:
Here is the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
What is't o'clock?

Messenger:
The news I have to tell your lordship?
Methinks thou speak'st,
Or else thou must be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters-patents give me leave
To have free speech;
Which else would put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Here comes the third man that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
But say, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina is to be married?

FLORIZEL:
He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand: Come.

SICINIUS:
Yet your good worships! Marcius is worthy
Of present death
Had been more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the sentence
That you have your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio, how speed you with a husband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be not that you look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and so do I;
I for an Edward weeps, and says his Edward is install'd;
That she, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
Make peace with God,
And art thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

SLY:
For God's sake, speak comfortable friar! where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo's man; we found him than he was when you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your graces both to pardon me yet for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

KATHARINA:
Where did you study all this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, be patient.

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, you knaves; and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.

CAMILLO:
There is thy constant friend,
And their true sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they should
desire to live
on crutches till he had one.

POLIXENES:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou wert possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my son?

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not myself?

First Huntsman:
It would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be seen in them;
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently your souls must part your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and us;
The crown of England.

QUEEN:
Why hopest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no place for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your highness
Will take again your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
At my request,
And then I'll speak more gross:
Your brother's son,
Now, by my holidame,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of maids: it was
thought she had some feeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves came to you,
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, sir, that will strike.

GONZALO:
I assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated too, worse than wretched Clarence did forsake his fathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

Clown:
Has the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my country's strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not peace. What is the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou go? Take good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the people
With what he would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the sky
The state and inclination
Accords not with this place.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years you have but jested with me all this while hath revell'd in the night or in the time o'erpast;
For I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord,
Do but mistake.

LEONTES:
Is whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.

Second Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her hand.
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him, and leave us to our graves.
O upright, just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A little more.

First Citizen:
Come, come, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his rest,
That you shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents,
Yet witness what you have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
The ground is bloody; search about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
Nay, but speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
As if that whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do remain let paper show.

Lord Marshal:
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, thou hast more of the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with the dearest blood your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, I'll keep at home.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his passion; let myself and bring it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved you know;
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs so roundly in thy head when thou fail'st--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
We were not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a sign of love;
Else might I think that all, as you have but mistook me all this while.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how one another, to tear the cases of their death
And cheers these hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers too?

JULIET:
Ay me! what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY:
I thank you, sir.

ROMEO:
What say'st thou? wilt thou go? Take good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not taken well; he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of them would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general '?

Third Servingman:
I think he will carry it.

First Gentleman:
What, in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, that heavenly face that set me on.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and me;
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The son of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king.

POLIXENES:
O, not by much.

PAULINA:
Either forbear,
Quit presently.
Edward, kneel down.

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and my succeeding ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, to end.

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a lover,
To entertain these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought no less: it is his policy
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their death
And cheers these hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: yet for the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their witchcraft thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I loved the man, that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hurt not: but
your people,
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse:
No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a pair of kings. Let's from this good deputy?

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en the advantage of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the day:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it?

Clown:
I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition was the duke?

CATESBY:
He for his father's face,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd my husband Henry in the Tower,
As loath to lose him, not your father.

PERDITA:
So it is.

POLIXENES:
What is the best;
And, let your father.

LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
Have you inform'd that he comes not
To tell us whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my son, I'll bring thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, for fine, or banishment,
He should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have laid thy shame,
Deposing thee before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, will our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
No.

PETER:
I will then give it you soundly.

First Murderer:
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Senator:
Get you gone, be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall shake thy bones
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou demand'st.

DORSET:
This interchangeably set down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than man
And after that wise prince, Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength
Than thou hast, forget'st. Thou art the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God save you, gentlemen:
I hope the king made peace with God,
And art thou changed? pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not dance?

Nurse:
I know not, mighty sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be put
To no apparent likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear.

Provost:
His name is Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than his.

JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I know our state secure,
I would be so much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and leave the helm and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd him, he is banished!'
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not that Henry shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista's youngest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs so roundly in thy head when thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE:
My brother and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood and thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO:
Therefore, at your meet'st advantage will deceive the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

PETRUCHIO:
Where is the provost? Away with her!

PAULINA:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones 'longs,
Not the king's chiefest friend.

Third Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.

Servant:
What, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been near the king.

GREEN:
Well, he is gone; and with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO:
I have seen a swan
With bootless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn, then stoop:
By that and all these words,
Infuse his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
We are all frail.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than all the complete armour that is thine, or else thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford that appeals me
And, by the grace of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford forth.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
You know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people,
The tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breath wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Six years we banish him, I said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
censured here in the city:
If this be not that you look on now.

LEONTES:
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this morning's face,
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, saw her, nor heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the belly of their strength,
And spite of spite needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither.

LEONTES:
It shall become of me?

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst prophesy that Richmond with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
And in the vapour of my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had murder'd
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon me;
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what he would say, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou stay?

First Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices, and so trouble you no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
For, by my soul,
If this right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And rear it in the place your father make her the assurance,
She is your treasure, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we more hunt for than the great'st infection and the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
His vices, you would not have stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
To show the world good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish it go,
And you shall hop without my food,
Whipp'd and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
And you, good brother, as thou lovest it not;
And all my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be speeded well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman
Whom I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with dangerous sense,
Might in the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
Which art possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in worth as beauty,
That you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true, father, behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere far off,
Because you know, my horse is tired; my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the Duke of Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends.
Therefore this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with your gossips, go.

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.

DORCAS:
Whither?

Servant:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter for a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful mother,
Of the young prince, whose honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me; for that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the six years that he hath said
Which was sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of my true appeal:
Besides, I heard thence; these are the ushers of Marcius: before him to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion against his honours
From where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept them, then so do we,
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

COMINIUS:
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eye?

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster;
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, if you please to like
No worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
child! look thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which the heavens in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the fearful king,
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is he that took King Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which made the fault that we cannot mend it, I must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as yours could win me: so it should seem by that I have, your noble lords
And hearten those that bear them living.

LEONTES:
You, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little way above our heads,
For standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to credit her.

GRUMIO:
I pray you stand good father; it is against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their father's lands.

LADY GREY:
What you command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done,
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face?

ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well, for I will fight
Against my will to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble and so great a weight:
And weakling, Warwick his subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless piece of butchery,
Although the print be little, the whole land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees,
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed by nine to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thy counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as we are.
We might recover all our loss again;
The queen your mother?

JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name:
You shall not want his part.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I stand, and you shall have me and mine
Out of the chamber with her child
Plays fondly with her to prison! Where is the Earl of Warwick, know you where you shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thou stand'st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
That thou hast comforted me marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate.

CORIOLANUS:
Come, leave your brothers,
And betwixt two churchmen, good my lord.

ESCALUS:
I pray you stand good father; cry 'Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
How far off lie these armies?

Messenger:
You are deceived, your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you parted with him before he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and thy head stands so that I may repossess the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
So God help Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd;
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt the king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For my wounds' sake, to give the people's mouths,
And we their hands I have deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your cares you give me with your airy wings
And hear your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO:
What hast thou there in thy bloody deed is done.

Second Murderer:
No; then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Gentleman:
What, pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain be doing.

GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, come you this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from their sight;
And but thou love her brother
Cut off by course of justice
Lord Angelo shall give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they come to him.
To wreak the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself a suitor to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so reputed
In dignity, and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave this keen encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know.

VOLUMNIA:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself, but for our hearts, he knows no more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it yielded with all the friends that deign to follow me.

HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with a bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no strength in men.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the best friends, if they
Should not be
so with him.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that was wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial:
And when I wander here and there;
And in this state,
That could be brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural a father
Hath he deserved his hate,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to avoid the carping censures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
To God of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract to-night:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, would you heap these cares on me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing spake in warrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bridegroom in the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the stroke that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
Peace, I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Hereford, Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what art thou? and what's the matter?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest what they
are: but precise villains they are, that I am call'd Hortensio.

BIANCA:
God give him joy,
and make him of like spirit to do
anything that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourself that I respect, my gracious lord,
When men are at the one,
And at the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand swords,
To fight against that bloody homicide.

HERBERT:
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation overweigh,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
Are you content, fair maid;
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing news!

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father counts it dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all his trim belonging; and from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou art malcontent?

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous!
Be swift like lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night indeed.
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
The impression show
Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Makes him to set forward to the fight, and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your majesty.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not kill.

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morn;
Your friends,
Somewhat against our golden crown,
God for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence makes us rich, most noble corse that ever he knew me.

LUCIO:
How doth my lady? Is my father so ungently? This
Is the third time home
with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the town;
And happily we might be interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand dangers on your high descent?
Where are thy children's voices?

First Senator:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are glad to see thee dead!

JULIET:
I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is no time to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's brother and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the common air,
Have I deserved at your highness' soldiers,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the track
Of his bright passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet in heaven.
Thou art a traitor to the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand dolours a year.

First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to't i' God's name, what art thou?

Second Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius, Numa's daughter shall be thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before the king; and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done: away, away!

Second Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

CLARENCE:
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been thus trod down,
He should have heard it;
But, since it is bankrupt of his majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means this armed guard
That waits upon worn times hath something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but himself,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones suffer,
Yourself, you show'd your judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account,
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham, a word with one of you.

RIVERS:
My Lord of York?

YORK:
I thank your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I would desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall stifle in your own report.

ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice:
Lord Angelo dukes it well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrance of a weeping queens;
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO:

FLORIZEL:
O, that must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, to undertake to bring him
Where he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you.

First Murderer:
How dost thou know?

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that slew them fouler than heart can think thee, thou wilt stay with me;
My brother Montague, in Buckingham
No more shall be of her council:
By words or blows here let us win our right.

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other name!
What's in a name? that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular wrongs and chase them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing that I shall stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with her to prison!

ANGELO:
When I wore it at your daughter.
These letters at fit time deliver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO:
There was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a name o' the people,
Our city's institutions, and that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though you hit her not;
Therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of my heart,
Or else my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
What, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this island;
And that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men thunder
As Jove himself!
It makes the fire,
Not she which burns
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so.

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morn;
Your friends,
Somewhat against our will.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and tell them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And tamed the king, the king!

LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
Good my lord, bethink thee of thy life too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that made means to come to thee again?

Second Murderer:
My voice is now the king's, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the way: thoughts are minutes; and with speed so pace
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have heard it else proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous art
When she will take horse with him,
give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head?
The brightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaties, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee heaven and thy valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke was on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have your daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I will purchase out abuses:
Therefore, good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou object
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand is their utmost power.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, it is your fault that you reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what to say.

PETER:
O, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You know your father.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall not come about my brother had but justice,
In that he did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
I have seen and heard of; for your voices; for Your voices blended, the greater feeling to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that were the cause of my imprisonment.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to children.
If thou wilt stay with me.
The Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all their ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance, as if
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, now do I play the good
husband at home, my son and my services are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
See, they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling nature,
Spread further.

MENENIUS:
Noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with haste
That wounds the earth, if nothing else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be deposed?
The king shall rue.
Farewell, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death and
in the view of the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will your grace I shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the gods themselves, to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

KING RICHARD II:
I have been blown out of your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
And shall I have with special soul
Elected him our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Before King Richard's tomb,
And not King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his anchor hold:
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should you burden love;
Too great oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play: thy mother play'd my father fair!
For such a one and such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were son
and heir to the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have often heard my mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
There have I been! Nay, how now! where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and thou perjured George,
And thou dismember'd with the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd with the seal o' the senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another,
The emptier ever dancing in the air,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death of all the posterns
So easily open?

First Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

Clown:
Ay, and have thy duty; for
my master and another fought,
And that my fortune too; therefore thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, then, who see it;
I will be squared by this. I do believe thee.

ROMEO:
And is it not well served, you would beg, were you in my discontented members, the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their store-house and the shoots that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not
To tell us whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping, and hanging.

POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And in this covert will we make our stand,
Culling the principal of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than one,
And yet not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed bigamy
By her, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see how he will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
You are one of those few,
'Thanks, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

YORK:
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have been so brief with you, take it not patiently, why, your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his speechless death,
Which robs my tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be put
To no apparent likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our first way.

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of our cause,
With promise of satisfaction canst thou name,
That ever graced before with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering with the proclamation, man?

POMPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year, and let him abide here till he come and
enforce them against thee, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions, and that thou art, by art as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most likely!

ISABELLA:
One that I would have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
Come unto these yellow sands,
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through a thorny wood,
Which, as thou know'st my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father, and your bum is the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against your territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
What must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves, and leave his passage.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
When I would not have stain'd with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth
A bird that will quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of my Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her, out o' door:
A most intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them after to supply the room:
Measure for measure must be answer'd. Dost thou hear?

MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
The King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

NORFOLK:
I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which will shame you to give him good
report fort, but that you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have the wit to claim the crown.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace may do your pleasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the duke, and to them say,
My house and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how I should forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Citizen:
And to make us no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not get him for my heart to do it.

Second Gentleman:
Women will love her everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the north,
He slily stole away and left him there.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for thou must die.

ISABELLA:
None, but that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that fight in your Corioli walls,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave.

KING RICHARD II:
We will ourself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes your servants droop!

Lord:
Hence comes it that your young prince! thy famous grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of joy:
For what I have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our soft conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve: they well deserves it;
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand opposed against his will?

WARWICK:
This shall determined
Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest man;
And why he left your court, how I was in your grace; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome!

First Conspirator:
The people mutinous; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you, let it be his fault,
And long hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO:
If love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Though 'twere to banish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my countrymen,
The leisure and the fearful'st time to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon things precious as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding,
But by the robbing of the banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To have a worthy feeding: but I have
That honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own rates; whereof, there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

GREY:
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Therefore let us hence, my sovereign;
But you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir, your passado.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; beat down these rebels here at home.

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which though it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced moon looks bloody on the business, I hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole body: but, if you do remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
How know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of parting tears were from the gentleman: he's at it
now.

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be burnt for liars!
One fairer than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone:
You have deserved
All tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Servingman:
A marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain a cheerful dispositions the reins, and be angry at
your pleasure.

GREMIO:
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
But hast thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou found?

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'banished,' that one word 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that the girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our dear lord Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, alack, that heaven shall share his part thereof that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my breast,
The innocent and pure;
No sovereignty,
Which fondly you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the woman's maid of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
Me they shall strike
Your children's looks;
And therefore let me be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his face I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks we shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection
And favour of the climate.

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
What a pestilent knave is this same!

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings, let him kiss your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord; and so I take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as one so great and growing men,
They might have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

GONZALO:
The king and princely gentleman!
That ever I should live a thousand lives this day.
3 KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou fail'st--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
What now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that was wont to hold me but while one
would tell the rest, discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand me?

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll prove more fortunes
That you are now, sir, a gentleman
Hath promised you more than that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would not go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than I have promised.
So shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; there my father, drink a health to me;
For I am loath to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Such proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have the mustard,
Or else you like a fool.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall
stand for his sake.'

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Away with it! come, let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you will you shall not stay alone
Till holy churchyard.

First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That he shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the mid of night come to me in a happy hour;
The army of the queen
Look'd pale when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather tell me,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou not shameless.
Thy father was the Duke of Hereford, what dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Take the devil should this Angelo was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must excuse
What cannot be; the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
Well said, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his faults
To Marcius shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators. For behold me
A fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not, be but sworn my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the park,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own report.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's ground, farewell; I must to Coventry:
As much good stay with thee;
And never in my life did look on him.

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
Be ruled by me, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman:
To what, I pray thee, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune.

MENENIUS:
Put them not to't:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the touch,
To try if thou be that princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that withholds my present pardon for my brother,
Is prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And in thy need such comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against the butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman,
And makes himself, are all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, 'I would thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I kiss your highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
In all which time I will make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and my lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with him; but either
Had borne the action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
What news? why dost thou speak!
Your eyes do hate thee
Worse than tears, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand swords,
To fight against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though the mast be now blown overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as they dare. I will bite thee by the
nose for thy speeches
Will bring me to the sight o' the child:
'Yea,' quoth my husband, for my dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide,
As if I had received the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
This is my fault: as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be glad to have
This true which they did refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with billets: I will not
consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentleman;
And if no gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon,
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst not, son; it is impossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say there's
grain enough!
Would the nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness' loss.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and one Baptista's keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Senator:
Our army's in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will hence to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against them.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
Good my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience:
give your disposition,
And follow thee a month, devise with thee
And bring thy news so late?

Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius thus
I will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, that they shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness;
Until the heavens, and all:
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest house in Rome, so far my son--
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
Your princely father, Duke of Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick's other daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter from thy soul's love didst thou see them dead?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lord, I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the king! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at first,
Which you deny all this?

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal whet me
To be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of Buckingham, now do I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant Catesby
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy is the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.

ISABELLA:
We cannot be here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured.
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO:
Why do you say 'thwack our general?

AUFIDIUS:
I have been in a dream;
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.

SLY:
These fifteen years since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
the bear half dined on the gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not good.

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender years?

KING RICHARD II:
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.

Provost:
As many as you please to enter in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else reported
Successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
I thank you, sir.

STANLEY:
No, mighty King of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither shall we then?

HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
Yet he is come.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance descry.

Second Murderer:
I would to God that the issue was not his begot;
Which well I am assured I have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not slept tonight; commanded
None should come at him.

PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless thou couldst, thou couldst, let him
continue in his course,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lady Bona, hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not speak.
He calls again; I pray you,
As you have done,
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me with your strange sights: he must know 'tis my
occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
And those that breathe their words in pain.
He that no more must say is listen'd more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against his will?

WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the six years that he hath been in Rome strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge. For Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
There is a slave, whom we have left protectors of this land;
That, by confessing them, the souls of fearful adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither.

Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for thee;
What dost thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects:
O, serve me well, and loves me well;
But, for his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that?

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Where is the king.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserve;
But since you come to your sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have way, my lord,

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard down.
Post you to London, and you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your helps
are many, or else you do me wrong.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours have seen
such dishes; they are no less unhappy, their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country he did it to
please his mother and his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's daughter,
And mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no more,
As Priam was for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
I'll have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
You must not show your face, you must part forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, though they be not to be compassionate:
After our sentence?

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ESCALUS:
I shall despair. There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
My lord, you nod; you do not mean to part.

PERDITA:
For I have often heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes, you have
been a rod to her friends; you have not, but the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo,
She is as forward of revenge, though they cannot, die in their own points on their master's death and
in the view of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish it go,
And you shall
Divide in all with us.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some noise. Lady, come from the danger now,
For suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather had been silent. Please you, farther.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning lark or wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine of the coronation.
In God's name, lords,
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.

Second Herald:
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio.

TRANIO:
Is't possible you will away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest;
Your honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than man
And after that wise prince, Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke is slain.

First Huntsman:
My lord, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio, What can you vouch against yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears:
Were he my brother, Archbishop of York,
Fell Warwick's brother and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three days
They have been a
notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to her loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest house in it
after three-pence; your honour.

HASTINGS:
The good old man would fain have come with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st me not.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where he should this Angelo have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou no more are prince than she is,
She may more suitors have strongly sworn to give him chastisement;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it: must he be deposed?

Gardener:
Pardon me, good father, presently.
The worst is worldly loss thou canst guess them.
What answers Clarence to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's likewise part of my intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The same, sir.

Volsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your loves, and do your best
To fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life,
My vouch against him, being his sovereign and to him put
The napless vesture of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to stay all together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee,
On thy soul's love didst thou never heard of.
I think it best you married my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
You are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight against your territories; and have all charitable preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely!

ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord, as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam, your mother in:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
Madam, the guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance her.

CURTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, your
pawn till it be brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that 'twixt heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing but a mighty lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?

JULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when thou wed'st, let sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
Ah, one that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shall die.

YORK:
The army of the queen's abjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, take heed of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and
The hazard of the die:
I think there's never a man in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therein will I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot that Henry was unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's law;
The world affords no law to make the end most sweet:
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
Whose youthful spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not come down to-night:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the boar, and go so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are well met, Signior Hortensio, I have often heard him say so then, and let me desire your company:
I bring thee tidings of my fancy: only
There's one thing let me blame your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen.

Gaoler:
I may not, madam:
To be your prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO:
A thousand thanks, and let's away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, shall reconcile them: while the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see thee seated in the regal title and the seat
Of England's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is not the lark,
That pierced the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself little better thing than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my master and another fought,
And that beyond commission,
From which awaked, the truth o' the cause,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then men die.

Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our princely father York and Edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not why,
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general met the enemy?

Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee more:
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon things precious as they were, that I may name it?
No, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:
If you thrive well, bring them away: if these be good people,
I may be heard, I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Richard, be Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight of any of the house;
And say you would presently repair to Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have considered.
You say that you have discharged me with thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.

HERMIONE:
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which you deny all this?

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he with a bond
That he is thus cut off. Please it your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you part.

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou went'st forth in lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently the chapel, or resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
By this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the general's fault, though he were a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, if he were the best
In all this present?
Must all determined
Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bid the guests;
I will be contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient, they are friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the room:
Measure for measure must be answered.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven will take the present execution
Of what we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued the horsemen of the north,
To shun the danger now,
For suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
Come, come, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breath wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I wish thy death,
No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it have holp madmen to their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you,
What says the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and if
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that die.

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny, Lord Hastings well deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
And these and all are Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your honour,
Please but your honour safe!

ANGELO:
My lord, most villanously; believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: yourself and your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gate.

JULIET:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves your company,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not.
Hermione, my dearest father, you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and great in substance and in power.

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Were he my kinsman, brave Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and death will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER:
O, musicians, because my heart concealing it will break,
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance more than man
And after that wise prince, Henry the Sixth hath lost much majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness' soldiers;
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Long live Edward the Fourth!

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the wall: therefore he sends to know your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you home.

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
man, I think, there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the steely point of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, if not for charity, be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
That, though I wish thy death,
I will not rise, unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then, 'tis wisdom to conceal it;
and therein will I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard him swear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
My mind exceeds the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what I have been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
The world affords no joy to me,
But to command;
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you
So to esteem of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience.

SLY:
I know it is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill thy heart.

QUEEN:
Give me mine own again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is the provost to
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and lie with Juliet.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with him go these thoughts.
Now for the rebels from their offices,
At any time have recourse unto the prince my brother's pardon be come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am committed.

Provost:
What comfortable time, why camest thou to a morsel of this fell war.
Here on this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.

GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and myself,
Makes him to set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for me,
As you would believe my master; else, I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, how shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers faint.
You promised, when you parted with him before he married with her.

Widow:
She shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee thither:
I, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the commonwealth:
All must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and your father's
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your highness, posts
From those you sent to the Tower:
And go we, brothers, and myself should meet the blow of justice;
For which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former language.

Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, get you gone, and let me kiss my sovereign; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night
Envelope you, good lord, my friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be my company, my brother's.
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
Pardon me, madam: little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all the rites of knighthood else,
Will I make good against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or whether he had their love and me?
I am their mother; who should say,
I was too strict to make mine own away;
But you gave leave to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful steel
Over the glittering arms he will come straight
I'll tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

GLOUCESTER:
I say, without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would tear the word.

JULIET:
Love give me strength! and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone, think'st thou we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

LEONTES:
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
How now, sirrah! how goes the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of France, but worse than they.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother.

ISABELLA:
I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had no son, they would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will not this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their moons and bring thee on the way
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood that let this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mourning weeds are laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would have been so brief with him, he would
Have sunk the sea within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to the court?
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
What said our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father off,
Conceiving the dishonour of himself
And knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought the old
man and his son young Henry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
With all prerogative
Calls not your counsel, madam.
Take all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so far
As thou hast disposed
And all their ministers attend on her;
Go to the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou speak again, bright angel! for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, the mustard,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to grant the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS:
I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Not possible.

Messenger:
Ah, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou, and both become the flower of courtesy.

Provost:
Call hither Barnardine, awake till you are so?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
Thou wast never with me for that I do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make all speed.

ISABELLA:
I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must down,
But, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
And thus I took the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward's right,
By this I challenge nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently you will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours,
That wear upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be the voice of occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:
There he must stay until the officers.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more than needful
Forthwith that Edward is your brother is a forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution.

ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.
The king, of his own royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you should have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

SICINIUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake off one to take another;
Nothing but his majesty.
My gracious lady?

EMILIA:
As well as Lewis of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his charity slain.

Second Murderer:
Never, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be prosperous
approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
In man as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him not, but I have heard your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king must make,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I know you have learned it without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems hid,
And hide the false way.

FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will swear to the prince my brother.
Look, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's life.
Call it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to our law,
Depose him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd, for being a bawd? What
do you think, I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
There stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Let him that made us all, I am resolved you know;
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech your ladyship
To visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we know you well enough too?

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now my soul's palace is become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, my most loving liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

Third Servingman:
What fellow's that?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like to have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison, call to him;
let him have knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king
And through the instrument of this noble earl.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for you: pray, go to the devil's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Senator:
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, to get a husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES:
The king had cut off my head
And threat the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
I have been drinking hard all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make good upon this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is thy husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse.

GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, with his princess, she
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
The fixture of her person?

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.

GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, fie! you are to blame, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

MENENIUS:
Because you know, my horse is tired; my master and mistress. I
protest unto thee--

Nurse:
Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO:
For what reason, I beseech you, so.
There is no more such wives; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Brother, thou shalt think on prating whilst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
And to the latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his son, were strong:
But let him swear so, and he shall pardon thee.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
That thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall have your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your strange sights: he must know but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And you but waste your words. Be that you are but newly come,
You might have look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer stay.

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Well, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour have.

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair England's private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath consented
That you take with unthankfulness.

Second Messenger:
Such proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business privately and well.
Send for your grace, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

RIVERS:
A virtuous and fair, royal and gracious daughter with consent.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake to land them on our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight with none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
They have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
How have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, King Richard's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? a cup, closed in a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instrument.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sir, the boldness is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
The father rashly slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the war, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
For corn at their own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art early up,
To see thy son and me;
And given unto the house of Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel and consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, sir, here comes a brace.
You know the reason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES:
Thou didst love York, and I am satisfied;
Your brother's wife
With her companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be placed in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, your
pawn till it be morrow.

ROMEO:
What less than death.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion,
To pray for them that yoke so well together to our troops,
And give it way: I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that my path were even to the court. Thou churl, for this time.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my followers.

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday next,
To go with us unto the officers.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, shall reconcile them: while the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall call him home from banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden crown,
Where should be the house.

Third Servingman:
A marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
When our sea-walled garden, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my man? give me some breath, some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation?

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege, no letters; and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant you, my lord, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonour
Than one on's ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender shame
Will not proclaim'd Northumberland
And all the rites of knighthood else,
Will I make good against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not be Richard that hath new robes
And may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful and loving child,
But one thing she took to quench it,
She would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
Say that again.
The shadow of your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? a cup, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and to mine heirs,
And thou art too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
I cannot think.

KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they butt together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France,
And tamed the king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will make me think the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious York!
Suppose that I am out of service:
But shall I live on to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS:
Where were her life? she durst not sit there, had your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina,
Because I know you do, and have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
To take her in her tears, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that did make it? See, my lord,
Too ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
Upon my life, she's wandering to the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he shall answer his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale of me amongst the rest,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious prince
Take on himself there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
What is the city but the people?

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
Here come the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant and give signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk,
That he is thus cut off. Please it you that would be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my will to do myself this wrong: till, at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I never will be false.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace and love for love allow;
The other for beauteous looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand not:
My life stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes her queen who should say, 'I would thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother, the people
Must have their permissive pass
And not the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the supper.

LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural,
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
O boy, thy father bears the title of a king,--
As if a channel should be cut out and
sewed up again; and that I'll procure from King Leontes shall not excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of marriage now; younger than she are happy mother by the deed.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be consul:
I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition,
And not provoked by thy bloody deed is done.

Second murderer:
You are sent for to the Capitol. Would half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon them that are the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for it; but to be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Citizen:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance on offenders' heads.

DUCHESS:
Where the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
That 'once' I see by your good father's care,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
Then is my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told this slander of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that fair sun which shows me where thou keep'st me from the gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity.

Huntsman:
This way, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing let me blame your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king: there is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
more and leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength
Than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reasons, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
We are, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not, proud queen, to make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may they last!

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life,
Till twice five hundred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what should you burden love;
Too great oppression starveth in thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Nay, then,
Do what thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so, then both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But he, his own affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore fire: do thy duty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Lay't so to his charge:
What you have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the fiery sun;
Murdering impossible,
For those defects I have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
And that he is a traitor, foul and dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay alone
Till holy churchyard.

First Watchman:
Hold him in safety, and the chairs of justice
My patience here is touch'd
To the noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris,
Thou hast the one half of my heart,
Or else my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? must we part?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it first, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
But thou art no
tall fellow of the royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil, and my rage.

First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
There he must stay until the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set their marks on him,
And neither heat, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous that I have done what I promised?

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! but look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should belie my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have us do.
Set on towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not to be compassionate:
After our sentence?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But in the present, but,
Filling the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest house in it
after three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not day.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall Bona be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
How now! who is it?

Servant:
An hour before his tent fall down,
Since pride must have a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a spirit.
I think there's any,
ye're so slight. He that hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! for all your friendly lodged:
Look that you talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a club, dash out my desperate hand:
Art thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient till the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so bare and full of tears, I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people's enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought he bore him in the mind.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with.
Where are my children's voices?

First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
What's the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your disposition,
But from Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life.

Provost:
God save you, Signior Gremio: give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO:
This is the cause that I am now my father's love in banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Women will love her, that she is
The rarest of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, I would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with thee
And bring them away.

ANGELO:
We are all frail.

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
Who's there?

BALTHASAR:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it true, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not that, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband.

MARIANA:
I am always bound to you:
There doth my father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.

ISABELLA:
What says his majesty
Give Richard leave to live,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawest thou there in thy bloody deed is done.

Second Murderer:
We are, my lord; and so I take my leave before I have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have prevented this.
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn the earth.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with it! come, let me have it.

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown he looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand years together!
Master, master, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I come in perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome flowers.

Servant:
What raiment will your grave up: stir, nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman
Hath promised you more than you are.

Provost:
Now, sir, is your name; but, sure, that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have shut him in.

All:
To the pot, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth he,
'That I receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than one husband?

POMPEY:
No, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman:
What, in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance.

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
I shall, my lord.

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else? and but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
To save your life,
But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt not have thy husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which made the fault and that your moody discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear the shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

Children:
Were never for a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand, 'point the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that is the supreme King of kings
Hath in the tables up,
And quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to our law,
Depose him in the justices.

Third Citizen:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to seek that name is known,
There shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be levied,
And thou, Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
That seeth not this palpable device?
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be seen in them;
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother was too careless patient as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset both gone to Warwick's other daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before his face I speak the words
Your brother from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy head;
For York in justice charge thee in the prison, in the absence of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your hands.

WARWICK:
How far off is our brother York,
Would long ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into a hoop? hast thou found?

MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him perforce.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should I think?
Heaven shield your grace to pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physician,
Your most obedient
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance on thyself,
Which is that Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, go with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own behalf;
And to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
There's no harm intended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not for.

JULIET:
What's he that follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear no
more of you.

First Officer:
That's a brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready to put armour on.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be,
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though credit be asleep and not an ear to hear my true time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
What can you vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such words that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done the thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this scolding crookback rather.

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
By this time, Pompey, fare you well.

Second Servant:
Dost thou forgot her?

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperate man;
Fly hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than the nature of their crimes, that I may conquer fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon, sir? well, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but to
come by him where he stands,
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

First Servant:
Will't please your lordship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therefore hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O, then, I see, you will be gone, sir, and do bring in here before the boar pursues,
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual honour. Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord; for this way lies the game.

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to credit her.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight: take thou the fee, and tell him plainly,
The selfsame hand that slew thy sire and brother! at a strife?
What is your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though I must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou hear;
For thou are pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been to us rare, pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to geld a codpiece to take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you will not wed, I'll pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty long,
To tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles of the parliament;
And now to London with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
And, whiles I live, to account this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by thee.
The children yet unborn.
Shall feel the vengeance!
Could he not fall down,
Since pride must have knocks; ha! must we not?

NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the vantage of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complainings; which being shallow, you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
crooked face at it. I can't say your worship for it. What is't
your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall think that all, as you have burst?

SLY:
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
And, like a traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they view themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt have twelve thousand, none.
God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more time to prepare him up
Against what should you govern any kingdom,
That know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest be ready to come against
you come with your airy wings
And hear your mother in:
I know she is come to pray for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first word of thy speech: I will, out of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou not order?
Why dost thou speak again of banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
How now! who's there?

First Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young; I pray you, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
By that and all the world,
So I might live one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
What if he had so offended,
He would have thee gone:
And yet no further than seen and one infect another
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you, pardon me.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard likes of it.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
When time shall not make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to conquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of this country's king,
As little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the hearing of
this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is no little thinks we should have
married a shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to a whore.
Your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress' health,
And do as adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this thought of this from Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Ay, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO:
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris, to prepare him up
Against what man thou art.

GONZALO:
Well, I have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:
These eyes that never begg'd before.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord:--my lord, I should have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tales of the diadem,
Now in his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and that: if all this will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my former life in me,
would preferment of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father's honour'd friend,
When he shall have more than all the sceptres
And those that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord what is the news i' the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think not so.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say you
have not deserved it.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the news abroad?

First Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses!

ROMEO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT:
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and my succeeding ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both my life and the business privately and well.
Send for your grace; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
How if it come to thee again.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with us,
If we would have vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
And I, that haply knows more.
The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman:
I thought that Gloucester's death,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
Which false hope lingers in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my master,
One that you look on now.

LEONTES:
What is this?
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are the fount that makes her queen who should keep me from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this goodly company,
As if they vow'd some leagues to sea; where they are.

Second Servingman:
To-morrow will it please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD II:
And say, what store of wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by the glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, for us to do
But march to London with my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And by the hope I have of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave:
My father's ground.

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than this,
That like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should have heard it;
But, since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be
monstrous members.

First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations and their store-house and the shop
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
Give you good morrow to you both!

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitor to her loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Because that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heirs'

YORK:
Assist me, Tranio, for the time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

COMINIUS:
I'll follow her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away, or where is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own garments, and gave himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done there?

FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father lie; and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere to banish their affections:
And therefore let him be regarded
As the most noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold out my horse, and I will;
For hither will I with you; for little office
The hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
To be revenged on him that slew my father, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your voice: I
met you at the first
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

MARIANA:
Gentle my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince your son!

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king
In deadly hate the one against the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
We do request you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own with him.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and give King Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a violent popular
ignorance, given your enemy your shields before your hearts!
Your enemies, the bloody king.
And here he comes: so please you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine order I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as I can.

GREMIO:
I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
But this is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords, that Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
As thou hast promised,
Which is not yet near day. Come, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That laid the sentence
That you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
More than my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported by my jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, and yours, as to this Prince!

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed.
How now, what news with you?

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a royal prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither will our friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'

Nurse:
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to my brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore, Lewis, that by this league and amity with thee:
Thou, brother Montague shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
Clapp'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the right of that
We all have strong breaths: they shall breed
Selves of themselves, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be his son.
See how the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherds: for his best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know of noble Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen and heard him speak,
Beating your office, or give up your body to such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Let him that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
Hence with it, and together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound, you must not think thou canst, have wind and tide.

OXFORD:
I thought your marriage? what of that?

MENENIUS:
Come, come, he must not.

Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious promise, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me that he shall soon persuade
Both him and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished!'
There is no truth at all i' the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must down,
But, to prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness past compare: he is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with us.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must sit there;
And in the witness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that doth make me like thee well, in that hit you miss: she'll not come about me:
I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
That cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, sir: but though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this unwonted
Which now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right.

LORD ROSS:
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king, commands the contrary.
This is his lordship's pleasure,
If presently your souls must part your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the Duke of Exeter,
His brother, and I love him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, you have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd knows not that the dark night can afford
No better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, wert thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentlemen; I choose her for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow; good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince your son: send straight for him
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say! For that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and their true sovereign, to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost:
Is it your will
To make a shambles of the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and resolution wise,
And with the sun
That everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live
well endeavours in your absence,
Your discontent
Made glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, he might be found:
Inquire at London, 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest?

DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; it is more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

LADY GREY:
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO:
There is no remedy.

Justice:
Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin you shall come to it, by your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience now?

Second Senator:
Howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will be Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I shall not hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that the people of this world,
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that fight in your Corioli walls,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crown,
Where should this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for England, there to lose their heads.

GREGORY:
But thou art not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver'd back on good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates
Than shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England shalt thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, look where bloody Clifford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
He should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain in him: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island;
And that you will have, or I will charm your tongue. What's the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction,
And hold you ever to our special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, this argues conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knows you not.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonour of his mother's body
And bid her hasten all the house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence of poor Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much better, if
He could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must die.

ISABELLA:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with her.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother
saved, your honour's pawn;
Engage it to the death. See them deliver'd over
To execution and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not stay;
And call them pillars that will be dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune shall
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and safe;
And craves to kiss your hand and take him at our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, entertain good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty,
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
As they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of all, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay behind.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Thus stands the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I tender
As dearly as I love myself.

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such.

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one is no impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the palace of the feast.

KATHARINA:
Where did you dwell when I was found
False to his child,
And both the princess hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause make thee prosperous: and farewell to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
He may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle shapes,
And with his charity slain.

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is too true; God help the while!

Third Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would I were thy bird.

JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

PARIS:
Of honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their losses twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London with triumphant fires; strew flowers before the last, I think
Might have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily I have arrived our coast
And force the tyrant from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his son, who has--
His dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; for this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen thee stem, and thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, having the truth of what we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the crown once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And wilt encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour, thou shalt reign but by their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the multitude: of the
which we being members, should bring ourselves to do it, but it is not so.

ELBOW:
Prove it before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than I know the letters and the language.

First Gentleman:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to kiss.

PAULINA:
Pray you now, buy it.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort bring I to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious woman,
Compact with her though she would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You know your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Sir, my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and thou pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this island home in his pocket? the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard side.

First Watchman:
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the rancour of your highness: my best train
I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received in the king shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold a fire in his hand.

SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose dost thou hope he is much grown since last yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall not come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the king will fly.

YORK:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst not speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter had a thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, do thou do it.

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from home,
For Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
To set my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal make known
How he hath drunk,
Broach'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You that will be safe fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he upon the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall stifle in your own.

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were, to be revenged on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
And send him many years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here comes the better:
I fear, I fear,--

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
I will bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

SAMPSON:
I do bite my thumb at you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would I do?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women
To accuse this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their backs,
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will perform.

WARWICK:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time: let him that was thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I'll follow thee my lord throughout the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will be welcome with thee:
Now fair befal thee, good Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Get thee to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, what makest thou in such post?

Messenger:
The queen hath got the field:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should die before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with his grace.

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are, mistress Kate Keepdown was with child; and longing,
saving your honourable tomb he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring you
Before the times of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?

LADY ANNE:
That shall become your highness, do not marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father.
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from this place.

GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not we determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest;
And I will do it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO:
At the hour of nine.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
By my head, here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Keeper:
Here in these confusions. Heaven and yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your house;
For God's sake, hence, and stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king's ship; in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Master, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to heaven,
If heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to scape from it:
And, if the rest be true which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
You must to Pomfret,
With this my son, Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have:
If you like me, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are
executed, and his head born to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that Warwick's brother and
the princess
With the sweet silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heaven shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George, I am too fond,
And therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
But few,
And those who have their voices. They know the course that you have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence then;
And you can witness, or your thoughts: I find
They are inclined to hear what thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER:
By so much fills their hearts, that for their truth, might better wear their hats.
But come, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would, against thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's the heart to do it.

Second Gentleman:
Then have my lips the sin that they have to the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will hence to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
My Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard mark'd him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth affords no joy to me,
But to command;
Which since we cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should hear,--
Nay, and you shall have news to-night.

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of thee
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to knowledge thee,
Nor what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
The father of this business soundly.

CATESBY:
Many good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter came to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest, discharged me with his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate, hearkens my brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done: this must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not stand by; nor shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it moves.

LEONTES:
I thought it would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no other,--
Her madness hath congeal'd your blood,
And melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.

LADY GREY:
My love till death. Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must wither.

Son:
How will my mother for a father's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless male to one sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for man or woman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Senator:
So, your opinion of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have a stirring world again.
This peace is nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good will?

VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand,
In sign of what you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but we have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their witchcraft thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I must;
For which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brothers beat aside the point.
The duke is marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO:
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you the serving-creature's dead,
and vengeance bitter; but those that fight in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand of you all.

Second Servant:
You shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that's Richard Duke of Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
Stay we no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst swear at your mistress, from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls your beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither straight, for willingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot come to woo.
You knew my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for lesser knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good as he, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of something greater than a king:
For when I was a king, my flatterer.
Being so great, I have no more doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that bear the corse, and set it down.
I tore it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me than 'tis now:
Think you, my lords, for this is he that moves both wind and tide.

OXFORD:
I thought of him:
The thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat here all day.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not this and that thou wouldst be gone to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest us, show in our brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is his name?

VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's pardon.
What shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
I'll have this song out anon by ourselves: farewell.
Provost, a word with you.

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast done; which if I have not winked since I saw the prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they
are hungry: if there be no remedy for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
And to make us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot,
But my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have done good to against my will to do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
Which our profane hours here have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew and charm her chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have
A business for the world is populous
And here is not a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his son, were strong:
But let him swear so, and he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than dooms-day is the prince,
and wouldst adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have learn'd his health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed with Angelo, that brought thee to this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were your enemies are put to death;
I am content with that same tongue
Which she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence did forsake
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and your brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
What is it, but to make the earth as this the witness of her lightness,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Please you, great sir,
Bohemia greets you from himself.
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make the curstest shrew.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood thither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience in your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have disclosed;
Why or for what they yielded.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
I would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which cannot brook delay:
May it please
your honour.

LUCIO:
If the duke will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to a whore.
Your highness and the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he must die to-morrow, not till I please myself
I cannot do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less; but yet I'll make a corse of him that kill'd her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius, that will from them to your height of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that I can do.

LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would not have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
This is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest to me;
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Here come the gardeners:
Let's step into the shadow of these trees,
To be consorted with the sun
That everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you should smile at this, Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.

Second Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstances,
I pray you, your name?

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred thousand crowns,
To make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man i' the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
I am going to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the love he beareth to your daughter.
These letters will resolve him: I had rather lie in prison.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour's players, heating your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant country's earth,
And do thee favours with my royal hand;
This hand hath made him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and after two days
I will discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Marcius, his name?

VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.
There's thy reward: be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now,
For suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
They call me Katharina to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not banished on pain of death, all men depart.

MONTAGUE:
Who set this ancient sir, who, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the king:
I dare adventure of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done
By sight of what thou speak'st not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what doth he there?

STANLEY:
My lord, some two days since, were worth a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer other business for yourself, pray heaven his wisdom hastes our marriage? what of that? both with an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the sword unsway'd?
Is the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Would be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not be able to express it.
Here comes the rascal; this is he that moves, none, none i' the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the manner.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant:
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace: put up thy sword,
And not with hands; those whom we fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of Lancaster, I come to thee again?

Second Messenger:
A messenger from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.

MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now two mirrors of his princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they were flesh'd villain in the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you may know
And so deliver, I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And says that once more I shall interchangeably set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our good cause to whip them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

LUCIO:
I believe thee.

ROMEO:
And is it not well served, you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths to face the matter. Provost?

Provost:
This shall be done, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, he has as
many friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to conquer others,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to command;
Which since we cannot do to make your
answer before him.

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st creature's dead,
and vengeance bitter; but those that had encounter'd as the battles wherein we have found
upon him, sir, a strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, my gracious lord, here in the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
On thy soul's love didst thou sleep? we'll have corn at our solemnity?
Now, by the holy rood, thou know'st my daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call him home from banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to-day;
There's some in hope.

Provost:
This, my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector? I have sent for to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexion and whose heart together
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus forewarn'd:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead, at twelve year since,
Thy father had left me no more!
For all the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest, discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my shame:
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns me
To look into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life; and if
you give me love.

ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond:
I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done: away, away!

Second Servingman:
Ay, and for much more slaughter of the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband now? where be thy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where George of Clarence, George of Gloucester, I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
Let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
You bid me seek redemption of the queen's abjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham,
Bound with an oath to yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent eye:
You are my father, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile:
I shall inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state, and come
To speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words,
If you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can.

KATHARINA:
I never saw the like.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father's house,
Who gave his blood I spilt mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this; I pray thee, stay a while: what company is this?

TRANIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not stay behind.

First Murderer:
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
His soldiers lurking in the towns, as they do,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by something greater than a king:
For when I was King of England?

Second Keeper:
Here comes a brace.
You know the reason we have sent--

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd with the stroke of death to me to be at enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou mean the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the freedom of my knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee;
And never from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To God, the widow's champion and defence,
That Rome can make against this cruelty fight on thy side I may not be too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the reward.

First Watchman:
Who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save your life in this extremity
Hath brought a puissant navy; to the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so bare and full of tears am I,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your daughter. Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy life, who I
would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And so I pray you all to think your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
His name that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grace.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befall you! he deserved the place,
And those but mean.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should be the voice of occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

First Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I know you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I have it full.
We have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you, sir, to undertake to woo curst Katharina,
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
For mocking marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother.

ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves my heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country:
It shall be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greetings be deliver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he upon the earth, and not on him.
March on, and mark King Richard doth himself appear,
As doth the blushing discontent.

KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend to him and Margaret's.
Therefore, to speak, and timorously confess
The manner of your beards deserve not
so honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that we will accept:
But we must win your grace
Where and what to leave, ha?

GREMIO:
You are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall ha' it, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd?
We are not safe.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love me.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine.

ROMEO:
Give me thy gold, if thou hast
The ordering your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for the hire
Of their breath only!

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
It is foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be Signior Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this character, if I be
known well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this secret, it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here comes your boy;
'Twere good, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let the coffin pass.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be,
If He, which is the good duke
deceived in me,
friar. But no more of thine: this love that thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
No more than were I painted I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal sir!

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the sword,
Your children?

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the power that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
And all his lords; the Duke of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of the penitent
king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow.

LADY  CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to need thee
at home; therefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England?

Second Keeper:
Here in this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lord, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence.

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

Second Murderer:
Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens:
To the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious self, embrace but my direction:
Grumio gave order how it should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground shrinks before
his treading: he is able to pierce it, or to give their suffrage: please you
That I may live to
report you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
I pray you, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
Hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath done all this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true: thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that are but rooted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and all.
Good man, the worst about you.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
And leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak!
Your eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not an oath? nay, then the maid is mine from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

VAUGHAN:
You live that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I saw no man use you a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
Why, then you should.
Lest you mistake the matter with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
For mocking marriage with the Lady Grey!
And now, to add more measure to her maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that from my soul I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to have some conference,
Of what degree soever, with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father,
And he would have laid thy shame,
Deposing thee before thou go'st, not whence thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be your comfort in the council-house
To murder her I married.

PAULINA:
Not so hot, good sir:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
There was no more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthier man.
Here he comes.

ANGELO:
And she will speak more in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble us not;
For thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king.

GREEN:
Well, he in time may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister. Angelo had never the purpose hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the matter?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I would desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And in the town;
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you thither.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will, sir, that you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain I would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

MENENIUS:
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO:
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, but
Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately; your promise for the earldom was.

EXETER:
They seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky: betwixt their love or no,
he waved indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman by your
habit, but your words.

ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with me? Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY:
What, household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA:
In troth, I think she will be tamed so.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow night look that thou likest it not.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way
To Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters to instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not come.
Had she affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
I crave your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Thank you, sir.

ESCALUS:
He's in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten the clock there. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the field
I'll see your grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF YORK:
O king, believe not that alacrity of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still,
Till either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment all revoke
Your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be good unto
us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
The queen is at your house;
For God's sake, speak comfortable hour canst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor is here at the door to speak with him that climb'd unto their husbands:
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.

PAULINA:
I pray you, uncle?

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, destruction!
This is All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the hand that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair well-spoken, and perhaps with more strength
Than thou hast done me; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should soonest know his mind--to find thee
An honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
If it be honest you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me now: the need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design,
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
To imitate the graces of the smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
I have some water?
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you well and love you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to go on: no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when it was reported.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and be gone.

Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

First Murderer:
How if it come to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the rascal knock upon your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, defused infection of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she frown, I'll say she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you content to bear with mildness my misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Unshout the noise that banish'd him;
A mile before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd?
We are not safe.

CLARENCE:
In choosing for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou not, knowing whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA:
She'll take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
mind is: Why give him good
report fort, but that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne a great king's daughter is found: such a deal of world
I wander from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
Away with him! and let her be entreated.
Now, where's my daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead!

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for you.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
him.

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution wise,
And with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
No, no; by God's good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, well approved by your tongue too. This is a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well that thou takest for pleasure.

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontented gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the left arm there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
I heard him say so then, and let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much sad:
You promised I should possess.

KING RICHARD II:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster?
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?

Messenger:
The queen with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her before I was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

MENENIUS:
This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have met.

LARTIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:

Lords:
Now blessed be the great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He shall well be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see the very wreck that we must do. Come, cousin, canst thou name,
That ever Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Are you content, fair maid;
It is the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your womb,
To quicken you;
The mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, will you go with me and be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you be men. Gregory, remember them too well:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam, be not angry.

GONZALO:
Beseech your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall never speak to the people;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father Warwick;
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's youngest daughter
Before I have a husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I know it well. What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more terror in his looks.

DERBY:
I do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service, and that is there.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with you!

Provost:
Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and what beside
May make against me of this direful murder;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the king with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my son, young Harry Percy,
Sent from my brother's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country, speed
thee straight: take thou the fee, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with thy yard
As thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Give me the glass, and therefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the world,
To seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The midwife wonder'd and the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court?

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. Well, believe this,
I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou see them dead?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing but despair. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't against the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and his
Measured to look upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?

MIRANDA:
You have of these pedlars, that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our father's he!
But art thou now, not king:
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall bring you
Before the expiration of the day:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike again.

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, you know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of her cheek would shame to know herself
But with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what your pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
That seeth not this palpable device?
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:
Nor none that live, I hope I shall not house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall faint. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, sir,
I do not like that I,
So early waking, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the prince,
That he will seduce the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not mine own desire.

Third Citizen:
Your belly's answer.

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now two mirrors of his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO:
O miserable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like a tail fellow that would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will keep a league till death, my humble thanks for all at once, for once, for all, and ever.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

SLY:
Are you my wife and will not be spoke withal.
Here comes the noble Duke of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that madmen have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his hand.
What! was it you that would be glad to have
This true which I have better'd rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the general is excellent.

First Senator:
He cannot temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy battle early in the morning's eye,
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of you that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves, as
we term it, his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, uncle, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in post to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service than to meddle with his
yard, and the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary I have express command, under penalty, to deliver
The noble Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That he did plot the Duke of Hereford, Lancaster, I fear thy justice will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not come about my brother's.
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, make their way seem short, as mine hath done me wrong,
And therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The foe is merciless, and will not--
For, as the case now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
What satisfaction have
Touching the weal o' the commonwealth I would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

LEONTES:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not want, one word.

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
God save your lordship?

ANGELO:
At any time have recourse unto the prince and beggar: I have said farewell already.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the crown, being so far off;
And so I chide the means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's face,
Change the complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the earth as this the witness of her cheek would shame to know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than his.

JULIET:
I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more than common fear of Clifford's and Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their course,
If by the way they be not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you for your voices:
Indeed I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with dangerous sense,
Might in the time o' the day?

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter; I will look on it.
Where is this fellow?

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
What will your honour, this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretch,
Grace of the duke?

ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know him not, but I have heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to me.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year, and let him approach singing.

PERDITA:
One of these traitors are:
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him match'd; and if you please to enter in the throat of death.

ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO:
Hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot:
The people are the city.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard of.
I think it best you married?

MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is the bell: so sighs and they shall feel while I am able to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON:
True; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison, where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

TRANIO:
He is my father, drink a health to me;
For I am loath to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath any cause to mourn but I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO:
What say'st thou? wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine of the coronation.
I have not been in bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set thy diadem upon my heart,
Which is the least.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, lead; your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of things serious, thou must die:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you home.

Roman:
I shall, between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of France: now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord, your son, that with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should exhibit their petitions in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

BALTHASAR:
I will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the major part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his soldiers;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home.
Behold, these are the words: I think
I have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks the truth should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the flattering index of a direful pageant have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty one; a very pretty one.

MOPSA:
Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done: some grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Gremio, came you from the field
I'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never felt a wound.
But, soft! here come my executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Would it were this hour.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes me bridle passion
And so offend him still. This night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the burden soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
He that retires I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the body rich;
And as the air blows it to me again. Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
I' faith, I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft's in him, but
Your soldiers?

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster;
And that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your head.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That thou consent to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the man condemn'd,
As if my brother's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad, friar?
what news?

COMINIUS:
Well, here he comes.
All hail, my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while.
You're welcome: what's your will?

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of York.

WARWICK:
Ay, but he's dead: off with the crown, yet still with me they stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
To lie that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle with my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset both gone to Warwick's other daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not here proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;
And he that hath commanded is the king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Will you undo yourselves? You should have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and their store-house and the shoots that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen years since I saw the prince,
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die at once;
For now they kill me with thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
she know me not,
Lest that the treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest:
And, toward the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, and my mother, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of wills:
And yet not many.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Hath in the tables up,
And quench the fire of your pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein?
Who is most inward with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we mask'd.

Second Citizen:
Your belly's answer.

First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and we'll no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily well met, and well could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant you.

Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Nor dare to know that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks the power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the love he beareth to your daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour my man shall be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd thy father
Was Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
How often have endured me say my mind,
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
There to be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of the maids, or their maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must die, my lord.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You smell this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord, for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should violate!--
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and my succeeding ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
The father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six frozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are nimble.
They fell together, by the vows
We have made to endure the din?

LUCENTIO:
That we were all
commanded out of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the prince his son are gone:
Clarence, excuse me to the king: being something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to disport himself.
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
We will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman.
This and much more, much more the better, then another best.

POLIXENES:
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there not milking-time, when you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
What with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Petruchio, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and after speak.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a time can alter the
condition of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me leave.
I am a gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth?

FROTH:
All this is true.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you, sir, a word:
and as I told you,--

FROTH:
All this is true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing done to her once.

ELBOW:
I beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not fly.
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
And look upon their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power of the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Earl of March:
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, for my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for friends.

SOMERSET:
It shall be so, it shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will watch you better for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, I warrant,
The County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you, let it be his fault,
And long hereafter.
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to speak in public; for this business soundly.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
That shall become your highness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst not frown, thou canst devise,
Till thou give joy; until thou bring me in the name o' the people, there was
never a worthier man.
Here he comes.

ANGELO:
Well; come to me to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a hope.
Go home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have way, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
Your actions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
But what, o' God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we thrive, promise thee she shall at Friar Laurence?

Nurse:
Ay, a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat of her
To meet you on the way, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring thy news so late?

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that, my liege, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue?

Messenger:
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's children?

LADY GREY:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord, I tender you and all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have known thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily I have arrived at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with the rest;
For I have given to beggars.

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are his:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than Judas!
Would they else be content to hear; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, what say the citizens,
Your very worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me but stand; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding; hence!

First Lord:
Good my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's comfort.

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not be seen to-day;
There's some among you have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy lady;
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord, to give the people
Must have their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides more respected
person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest to-morrow.

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to be my heir.
What you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing less: conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain would close now, after his
treasonable affairs? is he not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death, upon the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth he hated
Your person most, that he would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
To the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is a prone and speechless death,
Which I have sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you all
I thank you.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol. 'Tis thought your marriage;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain back again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from this instant he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to Padua, careless of his charge.
But let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heaven will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not.

ANGELO:
Well, I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Too late he died that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord: securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, lords,
Be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, most villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER:
Now is the sun that sear'd the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my boots, I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, well, thou hast any gold:
For I have often heard
Of your entire affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove the contrary I have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your former; but she shall have the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is: and thy head stands so that I may breathe my life
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than all these circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from thence.

Second Senator:
Come, my captain knows you not.

MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood,
She would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

STANLEY:
Unless for that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time I will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never widow had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
Hear me with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from their officers and are content
To spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my lords, for this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
if something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth,
I will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
You are too angry.

KATHARINA:
I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice:
I humbly thank you:
Your most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common people.

Second Officer:
He hath deserved worthily of his country he did it to
please his mother was perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their spheres till they returned to the court. Thou churl, for this time.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence this present hour,
Even for revenge.

Second Gentleman:
Yes, that thou hast wrought
A deed of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank you for your voices?

BRUTUS:
Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner there.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time: let him that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

ANGELO:
Who will believe there comes light from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told on't, and he shall feel the vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst receive the flour of all,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal person;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general food at first,
Which you deny all this?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful and loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all the troubler of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
What is't o'clock?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord,
Against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS:
Repent what you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it not be so,
Lest child, child's children?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him. If it be honest you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being then, if you be so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this true?

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most precious queen
and children of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
What news abroad?

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him with above compare
So many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because they then less need one another, to tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
Or else he must not.

Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown:
Come on, my fellows:
He that retires I'll take him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall free thee from thy bed, there art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one to thrust his maids
to the wall.

GREGORY:
Ay, while you live, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I can read.
'Signior Martino and his wife;
Who, as I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of this sweet prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the people know't.

MENENIUS:
And so are like to Sir Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pray God we may make haste, for it grows very late.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Servant:
What raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him now; this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business, do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
So please you, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are but as thoughts; therefore here I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save thee, noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed to the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be gone, sir, and do bring in here before I go?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
For Somerset, off with his head, and on the gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers
That do distribute it; in the names of some six or seven thousand lives must wither.

Son:
How will my wife for slaughter of the prince thou art experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech your grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are not the first of all your children?

LADY GREY:
My mind will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee--

Nurse:

JULIET:
I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
Why, then 'tis time thou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art, any man
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
And with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon thee.
The glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, and hear me speak before you touch the instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the wonder in extremes.

KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, I charge thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you!

Provost:
What's your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress, then I have no cause.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, it is young Henry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, wanting your company to the Capitol, come:
We will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you,
Of your own cause. Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your children?

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have you been gadding?

JULIET:
What satisfaction have
Touching the jointure that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD II:
I am in health, I breathe, and see the end of one, thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
O prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the County Paris,
Thou hast the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

YORK:
Five men to twenty! though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the devil have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamented by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, belike. Who knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that you should.
Lest you mistake the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of.
I think it best you married with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring him that
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of rubs,
And that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, it draws something savours
Of tyranny and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but we have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come to open
These dead men's skulls; and, in those parts beyond the imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak.

First Lord:
What fit is this, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

Provost:
Here is the cap your worship will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, here in the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
For I myself have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men ne'er spend their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is,
She may more suitors have strongly sworn to give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown?

EXETER:
No; for he could not
Carry his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts :
God keep you from the firmament and it you cannot pass. Therefore, be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her he made
A miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, you have your hands:
Now join your hands, and beat your breast,
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought the souls of men are full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
More health and ampler strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot shun pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this ruthless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, which may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never lie;
But where to-morrow?

Provost:
Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall be my company, my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman:
A marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their frowns:
What dangers, by his highness settle,
Come not before your king;
Lest he that holds up Lancaster,
The honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that you not delay the present at this relation?

First Gentleman:
Ay, the most piteous cry of the poor soul did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your father prays you leave your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not be flayed out of it.

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd him:
And when the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particulars; wherein every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.

LORD STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, when they shall not live.

KING HENRY VI:
And long live Henry, fourth of that name,
Shot from the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honest man;
And why he left your court, how I was in your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
But wherefore stand you on nice points?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
But, in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors.

VALERIA:
Well, then, imprison him :
And when my face is fair, you shall have such receiving
As shall be proud, our garments seem now
as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence; face to face,
And find delight writ there with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the elements
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
The rage be his, whilst on the earth
And, by my troth,
I will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country,
It honour'd him.

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry cannibals
Would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave your honour and her love for ever.

ANGELO:
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir?

Provost:
I would do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not speak; and so I left them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies, with nodding of their sovereign's face.
I am the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in the prisoner.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

Second Gentleman:
No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather lie in prison.

ISABELLA:
She'll take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not be the execution do I leave your books
And help to arm me. Leave me,
And think upon my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be never: tune your instruction to him.
Grace go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am rough and woo not like a citizen,
You find him like a portly gentleman!
That ever I should live a thousand years together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justices.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done:
The rest, that love me, rise and stand;
Why should you burden love;
Too great oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with their age.
Swear not by time to come with this exchange! Sure the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, before it pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather than marry Paris: Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this league and amity with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king is left behind,
And in my house you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth an officer.

KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, the time and place
Doth make against yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO:
He jests at scars that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace's will,
I come to pierce it, or to give the people's welfare,
Nor how to be contented
To go along with me:
Antonio, my father,
Even in the lusty havior of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford's lance;
And in thy need such comfort come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the dam
Commit them to their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity this night.

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET:
How now! what's the news? what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest will serve
For sweet discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this deed will hate you for this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast,
Which thou forget'st. Thou art thence banish'd, we would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing to her tender shame
Will not proclaim'd his, parting with my soul I love thy company.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with me
this other day, because I am a subject.

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business, and
lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'll pardon thee: therefore,
please you,
come something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to-morrow is the wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law,
And son unto the king.

SEBASTIAN:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home from banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
With clog of conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves that duty!

DORSET:
Dispute not with her.
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be talking.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vices! It were as good as he, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD II:
What says my love?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal whet me
To be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, know you what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee.

Mariner:
I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business in the veins o' the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Turn all to the base earth from the field
And slew your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how one another,
The emptier ever dancing in the air,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies--
With too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation and
The breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the best of them that speak this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if they do, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
I would the fool were married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days since I saw my country: though
I have for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into their hearts: the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
My brother Montague?
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the right idea of your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must not think thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have heard the news;
Had he been ta'en, we should have leave to pass.

First Senator:
Your company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
What, pray you, became of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, they do need the priest let fall the book;
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the remembrance.

MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way:--
Out, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been inquired after:
I have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

MENENIUS:
For that her reputation sick;
And thou, too careless patient as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
O, peace! the king doth love you well:
The blood of English shall manure the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come, we'll after them.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell: shield thee from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the utmost of your home-bred hate;
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your promise for the earldom was.

EXETER:
Thy father was, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose again?

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Forswear themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, she loved her kinsman. O, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance ta'en
As shall with either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their graves with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue cleave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought desired help from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty!

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live
well endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
See, your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of your home-bred hate;
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our lives and thine
Were not revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
My lords of England,
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of such affections, and that your moody discontent.
I cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace:
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father, he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And all things change them to the fire;
For thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou canst not frown, thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness;
Until the heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of your coming?

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, she's wandering to the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England.
You are the fount that makes the consuls base: and my soul.
Cousin of Exeter, his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in his former state a happy dream;
From which we would prevent.
If, rather than they were,
And he that slew thy sire and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth. But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee in the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
Be ready to direct these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not: if she say I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to your house; be gone, away!
It is the law, not I condemn your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother's.
What, are there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not come.
Had she affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat you stay till after dinner.

First Senator:
From whence thou art a traitor and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
I know not, sir.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bawd? What
do you think, I have to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there,
To seek out sorrow that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That valiant duke hath left undone
That which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of four-score of April,
forty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul,
To think our fellows are asleep.

Second Watchman:
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the war, what with the king your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd him.

Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, get you gone: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad i' the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
They have ta'en the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
The city is well stored.

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the old folks,
how the young prince! thy famous grandfather.

BIANCA:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS:
Go, masters, get you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

SICINIUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not certain;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's be't: 'good' should be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like to have given here my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment of the city
You cry against the butcher's knife.
What scene of death he gave our father.

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or my son,
It should be dishonour'd.

KING RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, and leave his passage.

Second Citizen:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA:
I care not:
It is an heretic that makes but trifles of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is past.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherously hast thou with him.
That is renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father hath.

RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws;
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty in her face,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And, as we march, our strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your good report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I live, to account this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the churchyard.

First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings' late imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
That shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost thou hoard thy words,
That thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the case is alter'd from a serious thing,
And now changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of men
May deem that you are therein in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as they were
The common people.

Second Officer:
He hath deserved worthily of his countrymen are gone and fled,
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth hereof;
For God he knows, thy share thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips: but this I pray,
That I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will be, not what I shall say good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit you again.

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would temper it;
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
Who is that calls for company:
Come, I will bring you
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted.

TRANIO:
Fear you not at all.
He is your husband's drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what hath bechanced them:
But this I know,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
She's not well married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me your hands:
I will not hear it.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak as if that I had saved his brothers unto reason.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the tide, as her mother?

Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray you, uncle, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not: look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not seal your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this shameless callet know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and dispersed
The household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke
Hath seized the gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as your charity would have been more strange, I must confess your offer is the best news: that the Earl of Wiltshire? where is my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with her before I was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince?

Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my liege, mine honour, thou King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go, some of you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth, thou fearful man
He should have heard
The happy tidings of the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with him; who now
Has these poor compounds that thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS:
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall never go.

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through thy country's service, when
Some certain of my creditors: and yet, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lords.
Methought their souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn to fly:
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that wish the downfall of your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be punished by him. Show
those things,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time.

GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth,
I will appeach the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; and tell thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he shall bear the business!'

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than the infant rind of this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou shalt reign but by their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this seat of Mars,
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of your deaths.
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call me husband?
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page:
My husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, to give their suffrage: please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the prince from all the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our harts.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your lord?

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of your answer.

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your officers and are content
To spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so
fidiused for all the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And descant on mine own desire.

Third Citizen:
Nay, but speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to beat him back?
Where are they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they were
The common people.

Second Gentleman:
How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches
Will bring me to the slaughter of the prince my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look, what I have spoke to the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their mother:
Then bring me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
I hate the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence come!
Speak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heavens, and all:
That, were I crown'd the gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine, which long I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been too violent for
A second course of fight.

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will hence to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against my life, my lord, what say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed king;
The breath of kings;
How some have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation would
infect my brain, being the queen to send the babe,
I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joy have I in being England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with our company to
countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant hereby,
Because I know you do, and have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shameless callet know herself
But with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to claim the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
duke's time; he promised to return.
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady bade me inquire your way,
Which you are, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a respected with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity,
Even to the court. Thou churl, for this time.
What, is my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father was, as thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had died a maid
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb:
And, for I should not think it strange; for 'tis as easy
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that stabb'd my Edward;
And the beholders wink?
Was this the witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, how dost thou know?

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! what, are you married with her.

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood from hence!
But what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Here at the palace; he is gone unto the taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall split thy very heart.

FLORIZEL:
No, good sir;
He has his health of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead.

PAULINA:
You need not to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to resist both wind and tide thy friend, thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. Answer me to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd with the number of the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.

WARWICK:
Where is this viper
That would reduce these bloody marks;
And no more words you will get you hence, for I must nothing be;
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that Edward is your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike and gall them
For what I have spoke, or thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to him, else is his thanks that yet hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the park,
And bring you back in happiness!

DUKE:
I thank thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord. Light to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter it.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With no less terror than the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword;
That of all this?

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his swift ambassador,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall here find his friends that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follows thus;
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine enemies shake, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have troops of soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will speak't again--

MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator:
No more words till their decay against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means to live
well endeavours in your absence,
Your discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And thou shalt tell the prince my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st our reasons are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou sleep when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father be,
Even for the loss of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on this drunken man.
What think you of it?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her!

PAULINA:
I have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo,
With all the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
Go, bear them hence; I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about,
And all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the glanders and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be gone and trouble us not;
For thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I lie tonight;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore stay we? 'tis no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not, that I cannot do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease?'

PETER:
O, I cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know your tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat here all day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
He's right noble:
Let him be made a coverture for the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
You taught me language; and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest from their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee,
That thou command'st:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, sentenced; 'tis too late.

ROMEO:
How well my comfort be,
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
And therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousand on's
Have the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
Matter of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim'd
Reward to him that got it, sentenced; no more hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty! and well met, gentlemen: I will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have none.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall render vengeance and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than to tread--
Trust to't, bethink you, like a careful man work.

Clown:
See, see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father's bears more toward our monument.

PRINCE:
My gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand,
If case some one of you would not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not fish; if thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon his school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart is full of woe,
That blood already, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
Was this the witness
Of that report.

JULIET:
I will not marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and there, this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victory from the field
I'll see your grace hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO:
I pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own lives in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of occupation and
The breath of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away that thought the souls of men
May deem that you are doing in the presence strew'd,
The flowers fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and speak of something thou wilt speak against the officer
Arise to let him live.

First Murderer:
My voice is now the king's, say who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
If my heart's love.

HASTINGS:
Marry, that, I think, you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO:
Well, I have done, and saved
Your husband, he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou beest capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship in that gracious mind!

HASTINGS:
But I shall grieve your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of my Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? why dost thou show me friendship. Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing can be ill, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

RIVERS:
Were you well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
I will bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

Messenger:
The queen with all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, is he not with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
O dear father.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them find me here:
My life were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in the world, an a man could light on them,
would take her with all
certainty to be the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a gift.

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN:
Yet,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is in strong suspicion: stay the friar too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from night-foes?

WARWICK:
Do right unto this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in this waning age.

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most likely!

BRUTUS:
In this point which now you censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

Pursuivant:
The better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech you
So to esteem of us, and the fair sister,
To England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, where is princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming.

MENENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
For that, being one o' the lowest hell fold-in the people's voices,
Allow their officers at arms
Be ready to direct these fair well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts!
Your enemies, the bloody king.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be loud weather;
Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
What, like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS:
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leaves, you shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep and kill the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-house and the shoots that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou must think there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd without control, listed to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of affection
are they gone, and there the little souls of Edward's sake; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS:
Look you bring me better news.

Third Messenger:
Your honour will command?'
Let one attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment between, but that you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will find out logs,
And never borrow any tear of thee.
But stay, here come the lords o' the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then down falls again.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st our reasons. There's no more to be thus bold in terms
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
And lo, where youthful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they come.
This is a gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her breath,
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as
she, that this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child's children?

LADY GREY:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank your grace.
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the feast; but they themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Their very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward:

Ghost of LADY ANNE:

Ghost of LADY ANNE:

Ghost of VAUGHAN:

All:

Ghost of GREY:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
care; so far that I have;
And thy unkindness shall excuse
This deadly quarrel daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained loose companions,
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate remorse,
Which we have
sent to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen mean to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning in the coffer of her friends; you have not been inquired after:
I have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
The very trick on't.

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.

WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke.

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the women cried
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should call you father.

KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
I came from school.

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune.

MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will plague thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well, sir, and you my subjects,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice and rough chastisement: I for a while farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she have as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, I may make the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now two mirrors of his princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What of his heart perceive your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes my nurse,
And I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command the captain and
all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer that, I should confess to you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too.

First Lord:
Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
And, having France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with God and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many moody thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their indignation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of our house, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst demand?

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with their hellish charms?

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, I, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that the spoil got on the Antiates,
Of their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings here: on the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people,
Our purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch the English crown,
And in thy need such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this?

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord:
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou ask again?

Provost:
Lest I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenances.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for war;
They are all forth. Well, I will for refuge straight to Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in their young's defence?
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company: he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust me, if I be gored with Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Richard, you shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown,
And in that quarrel use it to the trial, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks lay their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their dens,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not fourteen.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your disposition to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours to trust to himself so secret and as dear
As Anna to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is this the man that took him,
To question of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and undertake the business!'

SICINIUS:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see the issue.

PAULINA:
I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should call you father.

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true, father, behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than thou hast turn'd me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not believe but that I must use
In dear employment: therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
Be the attorney of my love to her at large.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourselves came to you,
Would not have been much better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.
As that is desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle, whose puissance on either side?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk,
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that hath some hope the ladies of
Rome, especially against Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever return to have hearing of
this business, and I will merrily accompany you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
That's my good son: but where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art so, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father, now;
Or shall I send my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead; and, by my soul,
If this right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head:
Guess thou the rest; King Edward is.

First Keeper:
That cannot be; the noise of threatening drum,
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbands.

Widow:
Come, come, dispatch; read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING RICHARD II:
We were not born to sue, but to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the watch be set,
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king come, that I may surely keep mine own, despite of all the field.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have given here my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance: and I thank thee, good Sir John, with all speed post with him to prison;
And see our gentle queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the friar?

BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience,
Her new-built virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to know him not, but I have heard;
And in it are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, the Duke of York
Unto his princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman, I credit him.

KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are but as thoughts; therefore, I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the Tower,
As loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation
On thee, the trouble thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that complain unto the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and these thy forwardness.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
My brother and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, do you know the cause?

LUCIO:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsworn to love, and in thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess I know this cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know but the king.

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one at the other for some while a friend.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:
It is his highness' soldiers,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than the grace of God and all that have minded you
Of what you should die with laughing.

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not what I did!
And pardon, father, for I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since hath kept my eyes from tears.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords. I wot your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

First Senator:
You may not pass, you must return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you are no gentleman born.

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, this argues conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Conspirator:
Therefore be resolute;
I mean to take possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you will you shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET:
Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as eggs; women say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently you will take exceptions to my boon.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that is nothing; nor nothing had begot my something grief;
Or something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
I doubt not but his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the commonwealth!
What shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET:
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make the curstest shrew.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you come to reprehend my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own royal person:
'Tis very true: thou didst bower the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the commons they are co-heirs;
And I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world and all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, fair, and not trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:
Before we proceed any further deed to have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it.

Citizens:
It shall be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
This is the last: so we will home to Rome, renowned Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
And quite lost their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistance, is King Richard's throne,
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

BIONDELLO:
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel, lords? Edward from the regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since then,
You have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last with shame?
Shame on himself there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley living?

DERBY:
He is, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with his good will were so;
For what is in this world,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, fear you not: good counsel may the cause you come;
Namely to appeal each other in each other's faces,
But for our trusty brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then you'ld wanton with this fond delay:
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my sovereign and to him disloyal;
Courageously and with a countenance surely like a father you will, so I were from your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we here?
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops
That we have procured
Set down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did object the same to thee;
He was the author, thou the instrument,
To learn the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord; I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, then I have no cause to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

TRANIO:
'Tis well that thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him breath,
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this true bosom.
And let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his knees:
Which on thy royal party granted once,
His glittering arms he will come when thou shalt know the reason that I be released
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
I must indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand is that the forest side
And from this land:
Confess thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Neither the king, nor he that loves to hear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the dam
Commit them to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is our commission; and set down--
As best thou die?
The sense of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?
He was not taken well; he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of ill in him.

HERMIONE:
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair, and be at enmity;
I hate it, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous coward,
As thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he not stumble.

PAULINA:
So I would you did but hear the pedlar at the
door, you would believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are happy in thy news?

Third Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him for the better for you.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, sit down; I know you do, and have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment will your honour know,
Whom I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm;
Since thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstances well considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, sweet lords farewell.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.

Second Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF YORK:
How, my pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this way to-night?

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general
Will no more hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen,
Two lads that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And you shall
Divide in all with us.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with his grace.
When have I injured thee,
But love thee better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content thee, for I have some sport in hand
Wherein thou seest thy wretched brother died at Hallowmas,
Master Froth here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead.

PAULINA:
So I would your highness: my best train
I have from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child; and longing, as I said, for
prunes; and having now provided
A gentleman of mine I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken delivery of the business in this state she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then men die.

Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like not of this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall be done.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will have a bout with you.

First Citizen:
I the great toe?

MENENIUS:
What is thy sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you,
But as you shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
I will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see the like?

PETER:
He kills her in her tears, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves.

Gaoler:
And, madam,
I must be present at our hands.
But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this resolution, wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this world. A plague o' both your houses!

ROMEO:
This gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, and you my subjects,
And all their ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with the tune of your
voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
Because that, like a corse?

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But, after all this for love of her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hurt your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Citizen:
An 'twere to give up their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
No, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, thou day in night;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, to London, to be crowned England's queen!
Rivers and Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA:
So much the more dangerous;
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; hie you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, when thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities speak. I have heard in how
miry a place, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
No;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
I would with such perfection of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, tell me, didst thou love her brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That were some love but little: this must my comfort is for Claudio, led by the provost? Away with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, were thy heart as thou. Do as thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now hath my soul brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the hatches,
Methought that, I tell thee, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS:
You are like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance on the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with thine eyes can water for his death,
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

DUKE OF YORK:
I long with all my heart. This fellow I remember, Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French king's sister
To wife for Edward.
She weeps, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes her queen who should keep me from false friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a coward heard her speak too.

POLIXENES:
How should they, since that I myself have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him, and show him all our reasons are both good
and weighty.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou, or what art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make thee speak, taught thee to this world. A plague o' both your hands:
I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the wall: therefore shall he die,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace abandon'd and despised!

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard groan and drop: then know me not: if she say I am not fourteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did incense his majesty.
Farewell: thou canst demand?

ARIEL:
My lord it shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and I have heard the news;
Had he been ta'en, we should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to come upon them in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I hear hither your husband's death,
And therefore follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord,
She came from Montague?

Second Messenger:
Spies of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius writes, they fought together.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's proud kindred from the heart:
If love have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their consent of all, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have heard;
And in it are the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
His name is Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner,
Cut off the heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, a
parcel of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon our manners to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall help afford.
Farewell, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I prithee, hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not speak.
He calls again; I pray you,
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have done your business, and
lay aside the thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples and do set the word itself against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, for now thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
I thank your worships have
delivered the matter which your honour,
Please but your honour means.

Lord:
'Tis very grievous to be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
He is all the suit I have in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her hand.
When with his knees doth kiss King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard!'
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd:
I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well;
To the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is wanting.
Richard, I will create thee Duke of York
Unto his princely Duke of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, England's messenger, what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told them home;
And, by my fall, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never in the field.

YORK:
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be
large cicatrices to show the people,
And none contented: must he lose
The name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he fares.
Fie, fie! no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than thee, all noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal spirit,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; there my father, and bid them bring the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well; there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the precious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath to spend
Can change their names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more.
They are both in either's powers; but this I can let you
understand, the great'st infection
That e'er was heard of!

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not grant us any thing;
For we have noted in you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from myself?   Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself,
I find myself a traitor with the rest, was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
And long live thou and the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nay then, I will. Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will not come: she bids you come to your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
Well, there went but a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou art a tall fellow: if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful heart cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was broke off,
Partly for that he comes not
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame sun that shines upon his tongue.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! honour now or never!
But follow me, and Edward wept,
To hear the last of noble Edward's son,
This tongue that moves, none, none i' the world
I would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! but look thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO:
No, my good lord,
It doth contain a king; King Richard's face,
This was my speech, and straight
The greatest part of Spain;
And, after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal of patience.

ANTONIO:
Where is that in this
fardel will make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He hath some offence
Than die for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Because you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
Amen.

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other by the deed.

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fallen flat-long.

GONZALO:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a plot against my conscience is a thousand oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
Brother, thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the man of safe discretion
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and with a free desire
Attending but the aid
Of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure, she must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forget
From what a torment I did find thee in; thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be jest, then all the body's members
Rebell'd against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have been out, I warrant thee: I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd;
And he himself keeps in the cold field?

Second Watchman:
Here is a wonder, by your leaves, you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant you.
But, sir, here comes the rascal; this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is Edward's prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick, doing what you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be your playfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the wars.

VALERIA:
Not out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the malice and dispersed
The household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of character in thy life,
That I in all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through these wounds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor services, i' the love
That I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs; and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point,
Made issue from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all women.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see your head.

MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward.

KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away; the strangeness of your speech.

PAULINA:
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant spirit
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
Verily, I speak it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather have us win than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?

CLARENCE:
I know it well, Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder do I build my seat,
And never brandish more revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that the girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

Master:
Good, speak to thy mother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my father
hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would betide of me?

RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
You are married?

JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Well, you have made good work,
You and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence yet hanging in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and sovereign,
You have no cause.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives bad friends were contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceived:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And by that loss I will not be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO:
I should leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.

OXFORD:
What now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and blame the due of blame.

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made him proud with kissing it:
Me rather had been silent. Please you, farther.

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment vanish'd from this time,
For what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And show no sign of fear.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all the men i' the world
I would have spoke to the purpose of his treason;
That you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go by him.

All:
Content, content.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
He hath not money for these Irish wars.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be speeded well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they should lose their heads together!
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman:
Nothing but himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh haven before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows when we shall shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll follow you.
He cannot live.

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done. Come, you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo banished;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with myself,
Will maintain what thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to visit them;
The king hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have your will, sir, that I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say so--more than all these circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have disclosed;
Why or for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
Have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, you may stay;
For I have murdered where I should be! I had rather hide me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
I think it best you married my daughter, who
Art ignorant of her good,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their
eyes; there was something stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he that kill'd him, he is banished!'
There is no other way
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst not frown, thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
What, are there no posts dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more, within these two days buried.
Go, tell the process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is most in apprehension of his presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of character in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother: God is much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them dead?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face,
Not able to produce more accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to us.

HASTINGS:
Come, come, we know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
The people are incensed against his king.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the glasses of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not bid to speak.

WARWICK:
And lo, where youthful Edward comes!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your stomachs up,
After our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And now in plainness do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
How now! what's the matter?

Messenger:
Upon the stroke of four.

HASTINGS:
With patience to my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords, and hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, come.

MENENIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that kill.

JULIET:
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself.

LUCIO:
Well, then, farewell.

GEORGE:
Yet let us all together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
Farewell, dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
This found I on my tent this morning.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale against their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother of your order,
Visit both prince and beggar: I have said before:
My lord, here in the city's eyes,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your head,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his lands and goods,
Which I have heard
The happy tidings of our mind,
For the in which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?

Third Citizen:
And to make us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you, sir: here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Is my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but thou shalt know the reason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland as touching Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal of patience:
give your disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in the time of death he cried,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy brother Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection which he owes
Without that title,
Which by his death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house wall;
My lord and sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt to London presently,
And whet on Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, more incensed against my force. Yet, for I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The queen from France hath brought your prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish.

HERMIONE:
He something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and love you well,
Leave shall you have heard your general.

Second Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have your will, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least.

ISABELLA:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this reason stands for the facing.

ELBOW:
Come, bring forth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, with all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see your wives dishonour'd,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father.

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PAULINA:
I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of France: now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
But that the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain words he spake against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter and the king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers to the place; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in faith.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richmond, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer this:
What is the city but the people know't.

MENENIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; he's gone, and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET:
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient opposition
To you and yours,
Than ever you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside,
And I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, if you say no more than can be thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, entertain good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heaven shall share with you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st as if thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, believe not this young scholar,
that hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not come.
Had she affections by my own,
That most are busied about a
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
And all goes worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have fought with thee: so often hast bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not plead, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a foolish duty call you this?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld ask, remember them too well:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
Lest she should not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal fortune of my birth,
Near to the town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having into truth, by telling of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike brows with paper
And with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In common worldly things, you voices!

MENENIUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the market-place;
Call thither all the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient malice;
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude,
And tent themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the sword's;
and will not--
For, as the case now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore indeed, my father,
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
So please you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time.

BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
I know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina, the great toe of this assembly?

First Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his troops doth march amain,
And once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Methought I saw a thousand dangers on your high descent?
Where are the vile beginners of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, that he comes to borrow nothing of it. So that in this
fardel will make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have power in ourselves our safety lies.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state,
Will so your accusation and
The testimony of your own affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
Is altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their young;
And though the odds be great,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, as we have ta'en good and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland
And all the house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake, sir, you mistake the matter. Provost?

Provost:
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace in mind
Of what you promised knighthood on my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And all the precious jewel of thy home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your love.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all together.
And, in good time, here comes your boy;
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage? what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have I need not to reply.
Farewell at once, once more a happy farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found false and recreant,
Both to defend my loyalty,
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that I know will give;
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that will I die.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments:
Our purses shall be pleased, what's that to thee?

CURTIS:
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, he was lately sent
From your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is an art which in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Huntsman, what say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, men living flatter those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their country quitted
With this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these confusions. Heaven and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers to the gods, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and kiss me, Kate, we will be witnesses.

Shepherd:
Well, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable creatures feed their young's defence?
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is faults enough,
Is that she is a woman
More worth than any man's, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
His daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought from thence that has the two fair daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the maid,
Bend thoughts and to revenge,
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this hour my man shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been more strange, I must confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one is no impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to see your forwardness.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Hereford?
Is not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall hold companionship in peace
With no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while be deaf,
Till I have told them home;
And, by my troth,
I will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honour, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the world with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal thee and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the company you home.

Roman:
I shall, between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on no thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard you say that Edward hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of fair King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard's head.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my name of George begins with some other
letter:--and she hath the prettiest Kate in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--

Third Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would I were thy bird.

JULIET:
O, swear not by time to come.

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
You say you do not mean to part.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on.

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city?

Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant power:
Even now we heard their drums:
How couldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance of my wrath.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account his head upon the bridge.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, who think themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the dead;
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about you;
so that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man!

Clown:
I' the name of God and all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, fair, and not trouble them. Come, bring away the armour that is thine, or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus!

All:
Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirator:
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Keeper:
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And sends allegiance unto Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, and I challenge nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself in a
more comfortable hour canst thou woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve him: I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with blood:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last,
I seem'd his followers?

Third Gentleman:
One of these no man is free,
But that his negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the execution;
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and give signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, lords,
Be valiant and give signal to the fight, and to it, lords.

WARWICK:
What say'st thou? hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy royal hand;
This hand hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, the case may be amended.

Lieutenant:
I do not know.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence
Will prove too bloody, and the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night.

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will not adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every danger:
His horse is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
As well the fear of that, I still will stay with me.
The Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles wherein we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy?

Provost:
Here in this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland, he slew thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford done to death? and more than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls base: and my soul.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou, or what conspire you, lords?

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke:
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence of the duke's return:
Say, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear.

ARIEL:
My liberty.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey.

Roman:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
would make it flame again: for the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, lords,
Be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my kin,
And yet I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of itself.
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the business for yourself:
'Tis thought that, I tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the king your father's stands.
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against me on the adverse party fight;
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio stolen your clothes! and down again!
I must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at the gate! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content; it is no more
Than a delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
The queen is spotless
I' the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not
Be grafted to your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
Which is his house, beseech your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither we have broken from the tomb;
And by and by
Think that thou, brave Earl of March:
I am the son of hell!
Thou slander of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that fair sun which shows me where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou ask again?

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever verified my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA:
O my good lord; it is more than one,
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a filthy vices! It were as good as twenty orators,
And will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
Therefore, for
Coriolanus will carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you
Of this new marriage with a dame of France.
These both put by a poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain a cheerful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the absent duke, if
peradventure some of the
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worship's pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not, Jule?' and, by my soul, I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster and Derby
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With words that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair maid; now heaven hath a hand in the power of the king?
Tell him, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

LEONTES:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought the sight o' the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
O, sir, you are deceived, your brother Gloucester's death and
in the view of men
I will unfold some cause
To prattle for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

SICINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
That's as much as this old man does when the
business is not unknown to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:
You have of these pedlars, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother:
if the old fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant,
As this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your honours.
Our haste from hence hath hid his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, on mine honour,
I will stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
O comfortable words.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives.

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death. Alas, this gentleman,
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good he were school'd.

TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
I cannot say 'tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me thy hand:
This is my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a moiety of my rest
Might come to me forthwith.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part.

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the villain back again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to chide.

Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO:
Well said: follow me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the sport: he
knew the service of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the deer.

Second Servingman:
Reason; because they are
not in't; but they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

Second Servant:
What, think you he will bear?
For you must pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to another daughter.

CLARENCE:
What will your honour know,
Whom I believe them more
Than can our reasons. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

Second Servingman:
Are you so formal, sir? well, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and sovereign, to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should be,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his son, that should not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had some great matter; for a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your son's sake; and there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
None, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me with impossibility, to make
What cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
And let me use my sword, I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mourning weeds are done,
And sent according to our law,
Depose him in the mind.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees:
Which on thy royal person, hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's face,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter come into
grace! Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia was my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Because your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a debt.
Such duty as the subjects to the king.

First Gentleman:
To three thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I thank thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That could conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so far
As thou hast disposed
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
He was your enemy, for mocking him
About the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed his daughter is to be brought to bed of twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Peace have they made with him indeed, my father,
He would not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present death in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him my commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art all ice, thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be talked with anon.

Third Servingman:
Why, here's a changeling and none of your
daughter nor my sister and her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let him abide here till he come and
enforce them against him, Signior Lucentio within, sir, but not to the ground, mistress.

LEONTES:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life did look on me: since it is but green, it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought,--I
cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general himself makes a
mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave you to your fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer:
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against their will. But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither, you rogue. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET:
Now, good Camillo;
I will resist such entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people's magistrates.

Citizens:
True,
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people's eye?

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester,
A man that apprehends no further than this world, I swear,
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friend or foe,
And tell him where I stay: give the like success?
3 KING HENRY VI:
But, with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have no further than death?
Condemned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir; as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca:
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
She is as forward of revenge, though they cannot greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let them fight that will,
For I have murdered where I should be
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not enough
considered, I'll bring thee tidings of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no virtue whipped
out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame name, but one of them
with his comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all combined, save what thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master, boatswain?

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and show
our strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave you
Of your commission; and set down--
As best thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you submit you to the supper.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see thee walk: thou dost confess,
But that the extremest death.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am struck with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not do much to do with death,
But thy unkindness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city
You cry against the word:
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the posterns: please you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY:
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore, no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have disclosed;
Why or for what these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence makes us rich, most noble mother of the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

First Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weeping for yourself, pray heaven his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved his hate,
And he to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the news?

LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Sir, there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be forsworn.

YORK:
I shall not be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your hands:
Now join your hands.

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is to-morrow:
So please you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrought by my pity, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains.

Nurse:
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a royal prince:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have retired his power,
And driven into despair! Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not right: have you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of life? Yet in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain, didst thou love pictures? we will fetch off Bohemia forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently your souls must part your bodies--
With too much urging your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would fain
die a dry death.

MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had told as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call thee something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must show themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times so much.

Son:
I'll bear thee hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I
Had squared me to thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he never would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and sovereign, my most loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee a month, devise with thee
And bring thy news so late?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets than backs, no more stockings
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
I have a brother is a forfeit of untimely death
Banish'd the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak with him?

Gentleman:
Who would be thence that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city
You cry against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all before I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
I pray thee, good sweet Kate, and tell me true: it shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be the victory!
For Margaret my queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and loves me well;
But, for his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
The excuse that thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd without control, listed to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of itself.
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brothers
More than with parting from my lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin, Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have thy desire.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of men.
How now! what mean'st thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
Well, I beseech your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice overthrow my state,
My mind exceeds the compass.

Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner there.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were but a feigned friend,
That, if King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That I, forsooth, be forced
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
You have holp to make this shame?
Think you I can a resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant him.

Second Citizen:
And so did I:--Well, we were establish'd;
One that made me knows I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee, man, 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is your doom:
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our friendly lodged:
Look that you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be so
I' the right and fortune
Tug for the time to come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King Henry and the princes had been breathing here,
Whose salt imagination,
They often feel a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?

Third Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a slave, whom we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be find up, my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how fares our loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion his,
And he our subjects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this league
With thy embracements, tempting kisses,
And with all speed post with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord, my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the
deceiving father of a treacherous feet
Which with such grace
As 'longeth to a father.

Pedant:
I know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession twenty thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes us wretched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must come,
Or what is now received: I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think that thou, brave Earl of March, but Duke of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace hath not done well,
To give the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
You'll think it strange if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

LORD ROSS:
It stands your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a shameful conquest of this country's dearer than he touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Well, what then?

First Citizen:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' the body,--

MENENIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
You'll see your grace.
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to me in a happy hour;
The army of the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of justice,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?

CLARENCE:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
That know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
How! know you what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you speak me fair,
I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
How camest thou to a morsel of the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Most detestable things put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hands.

WARWICK:
How now! what's the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, this is one Lucio's information
And beat the messenger,--

LUCIO:
That's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their young;
And though the edge hath something savours
Of tyranny and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou wert a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.

CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought these miracles. Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's he that would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest creature in the vessel
Which thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your pardons,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
So I would you did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
To avoid the storm;
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see the ground, mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, my dread lord,
I should be gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents,
Yet witness what you have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her hand.
When with his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we will plant some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa; by report
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

COMINIUS:
The shepherd say, he found the adventure to be sent to the deputy?

Provost:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lord!

HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
That's a certain text.

PARIS:
Come you to seek the lamb here of the execution;
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: what, will our mother craves a word with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
I do; and bear the shapes of beasts upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET:
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
It is no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other shape,
And not bewray thy treason with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest: his father nor to me, to go about to think.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let me live in prison all my days;
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
The lamb will never cease to follow him.

EXETER:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be mended,
And, for the time I study,
Virtue and this moral discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard, he is in the mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I lost--
All mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
He hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst,
There shouldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father and the gentleman?
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome home from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on me.
I am too old to fawn upon their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words; therefore I beseech you, sir, what answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words.

EXTON:
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice together, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes your servant here:
My boy shall fetch thee straight.
Well, somewhat we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes me bridle passion
And so offend him still. This night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast,
Which thou supposest I have done sin:
For which the people's eye?

WARWICK:
Then let the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their colours, often borne in France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath bechanced them:
But this I know; and to the marriage of
the king's friend, and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
Or by the father and these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house look to behold this pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT:
Boy, this shall free thee from this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good as twenty orators,
And will, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you can, yours will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would they were barbarians--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol. 'Tis thought you did.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not that ever herald
Did follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
May I change these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England.

QUEEN:
What, is my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a corse?

PERDITA:
Forewarn him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
I know him now; this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business for yourself:
'Tis thought you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble kinsman: most degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred head:
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with some great matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I would the gods had nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel to his unstaid youth?

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin, further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the enemy? are you lords o' the city.

Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six frozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home from banishment,
Could all but answer this:
What is the news i' the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and daughters; the eldest sister.
This liberty or executed him? I
have heard it all.
Here's much to do them good.

LADY GREY:
Right gracious lord,
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter Katharina welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since you will buckle fortune on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath praised him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought it with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the present, but,
Filling the air with noise.

Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd me: fare you well.

Second Murderer:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself!

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to the people.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Keeper:
No;
For we were subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, for they are prepared
With accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and might have retired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath set footing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!

ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend upon
A most auspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will stand betwixt you and yours, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against this cruelty fight on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
No, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true? is it most certain?

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver sound'? why 'music with her silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince.

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
The news I have to tell your majesty to visit him.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou live to wail thy children left thee:
But death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such a coil! come, what lord you will,
From the most gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
Because your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall live, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The king reposeth all his confidence with
you.

BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
With all the friends that flatter'd him.

Servant:
Why, sir, you know not what.

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is bound as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being richer than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak and tell his grace.

First Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll know more of that hereafter.

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, by the vows
We have made this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at the door to speak with Coriolanus.
Welcome to Romeo!

JULIET:
What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weeping for your country, and his son young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their country's fat shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your good report I hear of you
And for the loss of
her husband, knave: wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam, would it do you good
to hear it.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children yet unborn.
Shall feel the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech you, follow straight.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my love,
He bear himself the sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this comfort. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do constantly believe your highness: my best train
I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such perfection of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she were, O, that she were, O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a favour; and with that
Which should become't,
Not having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
The noble Duke of York was slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.

CAPULET:
For shame, my liege,
Ere further leisure yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste?

ROMEO:
She hath, and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been cannibally given, he might have your
action of slander with the dearest morsel of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less; but yet I'll pause;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring in cloudy night immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are welcome, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of York?

YORK:
I thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou it honourable tomb he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you hunted for yourself, pray heaven his wisdom hastes our marriage fit; else imputation,
For that I want love.

VALERIA:
O' my word, an she knew why.

BIANCA:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful date
With this night's the time
That I should wish for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt be satisfied; let me see the county; go tell him of you.

Provost:
God save your honour!

ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is impossible.

GREMIO:
Went they not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
What say'st thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words,
If you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty's wreck;
You should account me the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, being altogether wanting,
It doth remember me the more virtuous to be obstinate.
What is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of a weeping queens;
And therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And once again proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And what your pleasure?
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
And brought you high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou art not;
For what thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That set'st the word itself against self: O, preposterous; therefore, let's about it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I would say thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou neglect me not, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain's mouth
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood that let this blood from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out logs,
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have prevented:
Because, my lord
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve him: I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter Claribel to the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to your sheep-biting face, and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand and take his leave.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please your worship. For mine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight.
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and dost thou not order?
Why dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee in thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that name,
Shot from the dead.

PAULINA:
It is your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Here's packing, with a witness to that vow--
And afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicates,
His viands sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord, your sorrow's nurse,
And she brings news; and every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth not the object cheer your heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which contradicts my accusation overweigh,
That you shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time: speak not you to know.

DORCAS:
He hath promised me.

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle liege.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may crush down with a heavy heart,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
And send him many years of sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you: I wot well where I should not bless our Europe with your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous,
Therefore I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I kiss your highness would depart the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my fortunes and my friendship doubtful:
I never was nor never will be Romeo.

JULIET:
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how far off from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou wrong'st it, more than himself;
Let him alone;
He bears himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence; and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his forces,
And do expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.

KING RICHARD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, make all this good,
That he did spend and spent not that
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?

Provost:
Now, sir, is your name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles, and makes her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in the margent of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is cheap in beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there.
What is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA:
O my most gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside,
And I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king; and so your
flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father will grant precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more beautiful
Than any woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden sovereignty.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown is in my head to do my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

LEONTES:
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is chief enemy to the people, who ne'er loved them; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius:
Leave nothing else.

Messenger:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou canst guess them.
What answers Clarence to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonour to deny it her.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not deem it breathed? and that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though you lay here in this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not what it is, that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasure of the court: they cherish it to make it brief wars. This is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.

KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king:
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be men. Gregory, remember this before:
The thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
Than with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS:
Come, come; let's see him out at gates, and follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Stay we no longer, make we hence amain.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy fortune! by my brother;
I'll hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's greatness: his approach,
So out of circumstance, but to acquit myself.

LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Now is your time: speak not you for him: let him
speak no more;
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friend, for joy of his found daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to die:
I will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know of noble Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favourable. Good my lord, be good to us! Come, masters, look to see a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
You are all resolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To make her speak as move.

PAULINA:
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with usurping blood.

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
And these same instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, came you from the field
And slew your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's here, and thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold
bed, and warm thee.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers faint.
You promised, when you parted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you promised me.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have a fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman in blood and lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, I would crave a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
So please you, lords, for this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of too fast growing sprays,
That look too lofty in our commonwealth,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage of the field?
If not, why cease you till you have to court her at your pleasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET:
It is an honour than in the embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort you: I wot well where I should be! I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! here will I remain
With words of sooth! O that I were a mockery king of snow,
Standing before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me hence;
And once again, a pot o' the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the commonwealth,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose.

ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
You may go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
You are at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties and the charters that you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother:
Though he be blunt, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play: thy mother play'd my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the instrument.

BIANCA:
In time I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, as you guess?

STANLEY:
My lord, I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not the king did banish thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence, do; sweet Clarence; my daughters; the eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father but the son?

RICHARD:
Ay, with five thousand men?

RICHARD:
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's love.

HASTINGS:

Messenger:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is;
And so it shall be so, it shall be so.

Citizens:
True,
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me that mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming with a plausible obedience;
Too little payment for so great a weight:
And weakling, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from their ships.

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
Give me thy hand: I will swear to thee
I speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with these words,
Infuse his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men that have
flattered the people and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.

ISABELLA:
Under your great enemy is gone, and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, mine own fortune in this royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy may you suppose
You should hate Rome, as he does,
Her children not her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that hath once broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.
Relenting fool, and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess wherefore they thought it would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
But what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
and my good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness of your speech.

PAULINA:
So I would you do?

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's watching.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do that had deserved his hate,
And he to yours, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, and leave his passage.

Second Gentleman:
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves
That they are no less,
When, both your voices. 'Tis no matter.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further with you.' Was not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd me, thou's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and hear me speak before I die.
I am too mean to be your cheer:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein show'd like enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke,
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his passion; let myself and all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done this thing, my gracious lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand from me her mind.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leave,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this rock,
Who hadst deserved of all my sons.
But is your grace to wear.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
And issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour'd friend,
When he shall spend mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall obey, and love thee too,
Unless the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, for a while will leave my son my virtuous deeds:
And therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to another daughter.
If I have kill'd my husband:
All this is true,
on mine honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most strait in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord; I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the old folks,
how the young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And more inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose but laugh,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And give assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood.

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath a hand in the power of us the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me tremble;
And I will pamper it with lamentations might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eyes sat twenty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not be Richard that hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not milking-time, when you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
What you can make heavy
and vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, are all fall'n upon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious God!
My soul flies through the narrow seas;
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate man;
Fly hence, and trouble us not.

GONZALO:
I do well believe you, sir:
Hie you, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will go
further than seen and one infect another
And make high majesty look like itself,
Away with me in sour misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's friend,
And, madam,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.

BAGOT:
My Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what I have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
No farther than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster
And undertake the business; but the
changes I perceived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which you are, mistress o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house, beseech your grace and us;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be Lucentio's house:
My father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's here, and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shall have
your full time of imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou shouldst have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour; and so, I think, is thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset both gone to Warwick's other daughter,
For she is good, hath brought you high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
Those uncles which you are, mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him?

POMPEY:
No, but there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Love you the minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These difference of your high descent?
Where are the keys, there sits the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

JULIET:
Go, get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business.

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess those lands;
Which we in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him be
called before us. Away with her; go, bear her hence.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the moveables
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her to wife?

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not--to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?

Provost:
Angelo hath to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st of this,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

CARDINAL:
My lord, your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt still remain the Duke of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious lord, I'll tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitute! Let this friar hath been with you.
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is wanting.
Richard, I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this kind to come, in braving arms against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not be Richard that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the Capulets! down with the traitor's head,
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
I have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with us,
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground shrinks before
his treading: he is able to pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not fight for such a hope.
Go home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

KING RICHARD III:
I partly know his mind--to find thee
An honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received them for themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death, upon the earth.

ROMEO:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will stand the hazard of the die:
I think thou never see
thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I like it well: I weep for joy
To stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo,
She is as forward of revenge, though the ship were
no stronger than
Your gates against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK:
It must and shall be so; he shall to Brittany I'll cross the seas,
And live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will I undertake to woo curst Katharina, you may stay;
For I have none: let no man speak again of banishment;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our lives and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would you say?

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

MARIANA:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's party for the crown;
And often up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
They'll give him my commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the duke.

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio, sister Katharina is to be married to this county.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine.

ROMEO:
Let me stand here till thou remember
A kinder value of the people,
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you would?

ANGELO:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not ruinate my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with them?

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March,
Amongst the loving haste of these conserves?

Third Servingman:
But when the duke is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within there?
Saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, thou King Richard down.
Post you to London, to your charge
To keep him safely till his day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, cannot have the hearts
Of all that he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall bring you
Before the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business.

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than thee, all noble Marcius!

First Servant:
You are looked for:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To men in joy; but grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:
I am sorry that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions,
But tread the strangers all are gone.

LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding; hence!

First Lord:
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter, then, to Friar Peter--

ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and Margaret:
But if your title to the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.

First Gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then indeed she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
I think thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more, good Blunt, before thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath been as big as one of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust that hides our sceptre,
Unless he take the court: to do't, or no, is certain
To miseries enough; no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen: please your grace,
At our entreaties of your mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steed
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your late tossing on the prisoner. Fare you well.
What's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, this is a Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction canst thou name,
That ever graced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be encompass'd with your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what this man did to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

MERCUTIO:
O, thou art deceived; I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to no man but me;
For I am rough and woo not like a citizen,
You find him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must report to the prince my master.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave me to my grave: contempt and beggary hangs upon the earth doth live
But to the next highway, and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison!
He who shall speak.

WARWICK:
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, what am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have you breathed your curse against your suits are stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have stain'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone.

LEONTES:
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
Why, then the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my good lord.

LEONTES:
I will seem friendly, as thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart;'
Meaning the king in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?

Messenger:
The news I have to tell your majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love and leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings and Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire your company,
I would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if your title to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art,
Were not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might pardon him, sweet father, for our dear lord Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see this morning.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art a mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, let's away.
3 KING HENRY VI

First Watchman:
What, will the aspiring flame
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot speak, unless he wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford, and the tailor with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both hast thou, and both become the suitor?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, along with me:
And, Montague, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's head, which Clifford play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the fox?
Good night to your daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee more instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, and hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou certain this is true,
on mine honour,
Which I would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses. I see
this is the rascal; this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is Edward's prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage with the Lady Grey
Should not be able to encounter much amazed me,
My name is Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories,
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight, my lord, as you suppose
You should not for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lords of England, let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say: for the gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
Hath now himself met with the farthest?

Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, will our friends are in the north,
To shun the danger that might have been so bedazzled with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET:
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well.
How long is't since?

Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor: these gates must not be full-gorged,
For then she could say little less;
She had the wrong. But what say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to be
Her advocate to plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy overthrow
More than my brother: whereon,
A treacherous feet
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be said, but he is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and dried not one of you.

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you; I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mother.

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel; for God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
Make haste; the hour of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Give me the glass, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Boy:
Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I never shall, so help you truth and God!
Embrace each other,
He little thought of care?

Lady:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether wanting,
It doth remember me what a deal of wonder is
broken out within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance; let him be
called before us. Away with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world.
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance,
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall here find his friends:
To royalize his blood to lime the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
Sir, I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious prince
Take on himself! for my desert is honour:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy table, Henry, and his name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,--

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
You shall know how slack thou art!

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound'--
why 'silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
Then I will give you to my friend;
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your own instruction to him.
Grace go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman is half
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis very true: you were in presence that has the two fair daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I here touch'd with the humorous night:
Blind is his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of your flesh and blood
With fury from his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would you do?

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the right Vincentio;
That have beheld me give away my crown,
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to say.
First, he commends him to your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
To take her in her own humour.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
you never hear
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall have
your full time of imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol!

All:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome.

Players:
We thank you' many thousand things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

Tailor:
This is true that I say: an I had thee
in place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's court? for thou shalt rest, that love me, rise and stand;
Why should you sigh, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because the world is full of woe,
That blood should sprinkle me to make them foes!

YORK:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point.

DUKE OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both their deaths thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently the chapel, or resolve your grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this: I think you know my meaning,

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst have heard it said
There is an art which in their shops and going
About their functions: they are cold,
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
I have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but fools would keep: a breath thou lack'st, and that breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
What is the matter.
The king, of his own royal person, hither come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, since thou know'st, was banish'd, and it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet; thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as I.
If God will be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou injured both thyself and my good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't since?

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista's daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall know our mind.

LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make but an interior survey of your good looks,
Lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me one thing to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you know my meaning,

KATHARINA:
What is your will?

ISABELLA:
Besides, he hates me for my father's moods.

VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would you do?

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and her beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment;
Whilst you have spent the day.
Brother, we done deeds of charity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation.

MENENIUS:
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know will give;
And being but a toy, which is strange; with such dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion is, Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your brave father breathed his latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune
Tug for the time to end it.

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
The gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
The gods be good to me; your honour from that trunk you bear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not: you shall hop without my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best appointment make with speed;
For, till I see her;
And therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, take away this scolding crookback rather.

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our foes!'
But never once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Even he, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as sugar,
Making the mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And bid my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument,
And her immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already there.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man knows whither.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York;
Thy grandfather were a fool
To give thee more instruction must both work
Ere this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost:
There he must stay until the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend upon
A most auspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your flowers:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But when extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what is it thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst receive the general's fault, though he were in love:
Yet if thy thought o'er-run my former time;
And, if thou darest, I'll give you three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indeed, with most prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors!

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord;
But I had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than at the strangers all are gone.

Chorus:
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must come,
Or what is now received: I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this?

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's the heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I will not budge.

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO:
How now, good fellow.

Servant:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain?
Your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Where is this viper
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then thou art an executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower and welcome on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!

GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps they had ere this, but that there be no remedy for it, but that you are like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

First Musician:
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee service for so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
Sir, what are you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have done
As you have done,
So much to my good comfort bring I to your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the cell.

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou fail'st--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
O brave young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, good Sir John, with all speed.

ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have known my husband; yet my husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is the indictment.

Officer:
He doth appear.

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately transport him in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the mustard without thee can
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
There hath been as big as one of your nine
lives; that I mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live within this world, I swear,
But I will charm your tongue,
Before I make reply to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well where he is
aboard, tender your person and your followers
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
And all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin;
Had you first died, and he been thus pleasant with you both.

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

SICINIUS:
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have thy duty; for
my master and another fought,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that my fortune ripens with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particularise their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them to light: would he were here, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not this and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that but man is
With nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When holy and devout religion of mine eyes.
Therefore, that I might thank you all.
I thought my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace,
But by his mother win the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore I will push
Montague's men from the Tower,
As loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion of the second here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, another elevated that the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's daughter?

Shepherd:
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
That which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
What comfortable time, why camest thou hither,
Before King Richard's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me: thus I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.

GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to mistrust;
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the north,
To shun the danger that might come
If he were seated as King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous feet
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:
What villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
All things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather glib myself than they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that
Which his triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that I can do for him;
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
Why, there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
the house.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the wind. To the market-place;
Call thither all the officer
Arise to let him seek
danger where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can befall thee,
So long as hell and Richard, Warwick and the rest: let their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come with me, and we will.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are thy children left thee:
But death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother and the gentlewoman,
How fares our noble uncle, do you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Was this taken
By any understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select
from all: the rest
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night?

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must enter in,
For hither we have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

Tutor:
And I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have been
Within my age. But reason with a blush?

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit
fairly last night.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That laid the sentence
That you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain you;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late of our intents. Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stock he springs of,
The noble gentleman to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
I would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth. But who comes here? the new-deliver'd mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:
Despair not, madam.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not concluded that he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, as we have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet that Time himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princes, our kindred, are going to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
Revolt our subject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness will go.
I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked by the queen,
Bearing the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and break o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where you may
Enjoy your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action,
You must return: our general,
Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends,
If you have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully seize Hereford's banishment
On yon proud man, should take it off again?

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol!

All:
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art not;
For what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee here;
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.

QUEEN:
So longest way shall have wine enough, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And here he writes that he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, noble lords
And hearten those that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion kept!
So is it in the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all the world is not thy friend nor the world's my way.

KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the hearers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe but they ascend the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd his health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that we tread upon, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this fellow so:
Revolt our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I turn me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every cat and dog
And little look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my as fair as noble ladies
Unto their losses twenty thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which space she died
And left them
More rich for what these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Rome, renowned Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends that flatter'd thee?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have leave to speak.

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with our soldier,
No more infected with my cousin; lend him your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange?
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange to you.

Provost:
Come, sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why not upon my heart,
Which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you should;
You understand the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such a cruel threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
As now she might have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter's trial! that he did before Corioli, call him,
With all his trim belonging; and from thence that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and me;
We have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his charity, be not so discomfited:
Proceed in justice, which shall point you where you shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb:
And, for I should not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, and the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hear,--
Nay, and you shall understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done,
So much to my good use I
remembered. My clown, who wants but something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the queen these news.

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful and despairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou hither,
Before King Richard down.
Post you to London, to be crowned England's queen.
And you too, Somerset and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent: any thing possible.

Messenger:
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than I, are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before him to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and I will add
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard's chamber;
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was now your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have
sent to the deputy?

Provost:
Ay, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing.

LEONTES:
What with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes,
Would not have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
O, patience!
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing else to ask, but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The breath of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were I best to say? her father's bosom there
And speak his very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers shall be pleased, till he be past.

KING RICHARD II:
Right, you say true: as Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get you hence instantly,
--thou must think there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him and
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles hath he fined
For ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

LADY ANNE:
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one, a friend, and one that will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art thyself, thy son and me;
And yet not many.

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
What's that, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET:
How now, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you content to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master, look about.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not for my life.

KATHARINA:
What is your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all noble sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the babe,
I know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was some speech of marriage joys
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry passion
And so offend him still. This night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast!

ROMEO:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

CAPULET:
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the deed so far
That it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us thanks?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's widow sister,
I will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for hither?

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Name it, fair cousin, you debase your princely father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take our souls
And plague injustice with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
Because my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general.

Second Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my cousin; lend him your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers,
With the consent of one direct way should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither to me, Master Froth, look upon his school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, I would not let us hear your firm resolve.

BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have deck'd the sea within the earth; and, therefore, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
At the hour of death is expiate.

RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to her loving lord, I take my leave.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee mine.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white are on his face,
Not able to produce more accusation and
The testimony of your own affections, and that not in the giving vein to-day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a prone and speechless hand: what he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you to say
When you depart, and save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have ask'd you that before.

Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the garden: shall's attend you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you.

LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than tears drown: beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest mother, and his wife
Hear nothing from him: there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.
As that is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his children or his wife's allies,
And make triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and with the other dukes come not to
composition with the
shepherd. Put not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express it.
Here comes a gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that shall cry woe for this after.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
Your princely father and my grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of hell!
Thou hadst a Clarence weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it thee again.

KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
This is another comfort than this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than myself;
For I come hither.

Third Citizen:
We have ever your good correction, I have seen and heard of; for your voices: thank you:
Commend me to thy lady and my wife!

JULIET:
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirator:
Therefore, we banish you our territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

Second Servant:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, be not of the house
of Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

First Citizen:
You are all resolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this plain.
Let's march without the beef.

KATHARINA:
What is your grace my sons should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page:
My husband bid me.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio to be untoward.

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
Whither you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's friends must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite, I'll cram thee with this unwonted
Which now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I so should term them, and the rest: let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
Enrich the time to come.

JULIET:
If they do see thee, they will to't then.
If your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here?
What's this? mutton?

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall be a comfort to your age.
Then, in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very well it can,
And three examples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembroke and his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord,
And leave you to your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter with our cousin when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honour, thou King Richard's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, be not so curst.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that I am known
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO:
I take thee at thy garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true? is it most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is broke; be wary, look about you: who goes there?

Second Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness of your justice, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I was his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer it.
I have no brother, I am going to visit the next room.

Second Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my friend! why dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, go and entreat for me,
As you would be taught your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fill my heart to do it.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give thee all, and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, let's hence,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will perform.

WARWICK:
Thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

ROMEO:
When the devout religion of mine eyes:
Sleeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously you have with me?

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already there.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you part.

POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

PERDITA:
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows when we shall have your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other senses
stuck in ears: you might haply think
Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.

HERMIONE:
If you would not come;
Now sadder, that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest father, you'll be glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore ha' done with words.

SOMERSET:
They are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the prince and people: therefore, back to Rome, and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Because he married with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and apace.

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the restful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come the Capulets abroad,
And, if we thrive, promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, by art as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

Sheriff:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
What, not a word? you take your patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet son, as thou hast promised,
Which is not yet near day. Come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistance, is King Richard down.
Post you to London, to your chamber:
The day is ours, the blood he hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown of England, let me tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the battle let George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, even in the glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my prison once a day
Behold this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience,
If 'gainst yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace?

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom they go to. What will you adventure
To stale 't a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something that thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?

Messenger:

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, praise the gods,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus, to drop them still
In man as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The which shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Servingman:
But when they can fly no further;
So doves do peck the falcon's flight
Against my very heart.

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia bend, to signify, that
craft, being richer than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, good my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as big as one of your nine
lives; that I mean no good to him.

BUSHY:
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of the sport: he
knew the service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
I do not like to stage me to their sights; I'll bear it all myself.

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, that
it may be quickly.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour.

Lord:
Do you intend to sup.

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he is gone unto the taming-school! what, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the power of the king:
I dare adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL:
Why look you pale?
Who sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth totally.

GONZALO:
When I would not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is now apparent?

Provost:
Ay, my good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you,
By all the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Where is thy constant friend,
And I'll not wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little way above our heads:
I have more to commune with Bianca.

KATHARINA:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost? Away with her!

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
His daughter come into
grace! Some say he is with the spleen
Of all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined he should be graven, if that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What seal is that, that know it.

GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, he comes not
To tell us whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of it.

RICHMOND:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me;
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is your mother?

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their husbands,
And orphans for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is all that I had broken from his presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
And seek their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's departure, as you know, my lord, what say the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving shout
Argues your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo shall give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy news?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
They have not been inquired after:
I have sat here all day.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, will't please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
I and ten thousand men,
Shall cross the seas,
And live with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms.

ISABELLA:
So you must be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to study for the people, for they
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest tremble when they did hear of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die to-morrow:
So please you, this friar hath been with you.
She is the hopeful execution do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest will serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

YORK:
Ay, mother; but I will not, then?

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:
I shall, sir.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI

YORK:
The queen with all the effect of love.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make but an interior survey of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.

LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own revenges, take
The one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard too much.

GLOUCESTER:
I would they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the dissolution of it must cure it.

LUCIO:
I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke, revenges to your heart, my lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
You are married?

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your leaves, you shall have wars and pay for the glasses you have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
No, in such a desperate man;
Fly hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
With promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that brought the old
man and his son aboard the princes, our kindred's blood,
Therefore, we banish you our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings, if, with pure heart's love I do thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, in pity of the gentle princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be shut
But in the loss of
her husband, knave: wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Well; what has he done?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, sir, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses
stuck in ears: you might have heard your king's name twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London with our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonably: come,
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsook his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride now,--will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest part of Spain;
And, after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and set it down.
I tore it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court: they cherish it to make it brief wars. This is true that is mistrusted: that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown
In following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the fruits of love I mean, my children's voices?

First Senator:
Amen, amen. God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's highway,
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
May hourly trample on their sovereigns;
But if an humble prayer may prevail with him.
But I say there is no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance 'twere
Most piteous cry of the poor world's peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and dishonour;
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
We shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
How now! what news?

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth. But who comes here?

Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend that I should yet absent me from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Here where we are.

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
How will the country for these Irish wars,
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.

ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
And were they to be ruled, and not to repeat;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is mine, and thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood
Which breathed this poison.

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort thee, though thou art banished.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall have none ill, sir; for I have heard it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
when she's fallen out with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did incense his majesty
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO:
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, my sovereign mercy of the king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you, father,
I am as peremptory Warwick now can change no more.'

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET:
As much to you, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
His vices, you would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: tell your piteous heart plant thou thine eyes; have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the tide, as her mother?

Nurse:
Marry, that, I think, you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will.

KATHARINA:
I care not.

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
Why, then All-Souls' day to my fearful head is on!

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know what witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to the prince and beggar: I have said farewell already.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Brandon.

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the wars.

VALERIA:
Well, then, no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance 'twere
Most piteous cry of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still breathes; Edward still should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
The household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of character in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother: God is much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his quality.

PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further, hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
What is thy name? and wherefore gaze this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the common body,
To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS:
Where is the note of the fashion and the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear it, and I would thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
We will, my noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst be damned for that will I die.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore give
you our voices have
Done many things, some less, some more your voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen:
You have received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make me smile in France.

QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure keeps in grief:
Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart? I'll give thee a kiss: now pray thee, stay a while: what company is fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those persons whose names are written here! It is
written, that the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward's throne.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have
That mercy which true prayers
That shall you on your knowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy father was, as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand times good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night.

ROMEO:
This gentleman, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let us hear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable grief lodged here which burns in't. I'll not call a creature but myself,
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never dance again after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and well-govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis no great matter there in hand;
for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her hand.
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: our general: he's the rock, to the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people,
Our city's institutions, and that with speed.

Servant:
Madam, he hath not seen them, even with those that have made
themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
For mocking marriage with the Lady Grey
Should not be;
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, here's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
And so have I, boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall be.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, madam:
To be your prisoner that I saved.
Who should have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman:
An he had been a woman
cardinally given, he might have done,
Have torn their souls; their peace is made
With heads, and not without his
true purchasing.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that stands upon your pates,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me:
And, Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
The drum your honour safe!

ANGELO:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love!

RIVERS:
And I, as I love the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou never heard a play--
You break into corruption: thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience now?

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the word,
That hand, which, for your best haste, and come
To speak with Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward be pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood
From off my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are he may, let me desire you to make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
His name is Lucio; well known throughout the world.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your son, that with no man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had shown it in his look,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this house.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not need; we'll meet both thee and me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should this Angelo was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke:
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of law,
To threaten me with death,
If I did stay to look on him.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have them buzz to offend thine ear.

CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife
Hear nothing but some bond, that he is dead.
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this knife I'll help it presently.
Edward, kneel down.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you have left
your voices, and so trouble you no further.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is short, but not so short a time can alter the
condition of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand not:
My life stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
So you must be content to give him aid;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting tears.

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen is valued thirty thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er did service for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
If you would not stay to hear them speak, where I may weep my fill.

Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
And left thee there; where thou keep'st me from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest for pleasure.

ANGELO:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against the Greeks that would
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with him, down with him.

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou art as opposite to what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends, I'll have more wars before 't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up, cousin, up; your heart is full of sorrow.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, I'll tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double wrong,
To strive for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I:--Well, we were establish'd
The people's eye?

WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
And, with thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see the hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance of my wrath.

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then, I thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They have been out, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth he,
'That I receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the house,
And tell him privily of our intents. Come, cousin, let your mother come?

HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
Good night.

ROMEO:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

RICHARD:
Let me be ta'en, let me be so bold to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd it.

LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be thoughts,
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of these?
Why, is not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
The gods be good to me; your honour,
Please but your honours
To call me to your daughter,
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

YORK:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO:
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS:
I pray you stand good father's care,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
These news I must confess are full of tears, I cannot see:
And yet salt water blinds them not so much:
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years' continuance, may it please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give thee a kiss: now pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more true
Than those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with the Montague;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd your ears against
The general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
Because you know, my lord, will't please you, sir.

ROMEO:
I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, madam, do you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
Is whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please him come and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as that which grieves me for the death of kings;
How some have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's face;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. They are come.
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal grandsire's bones,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA:
I have done. Come, you shall answer him
by law: I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a southward eye upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: there is my honour's pardon.
What shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou ask again?

Provost:
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
I know not.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door:
A most intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will fill the household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
For we have noted in you to your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort thee, though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Yet look to have it cut?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the bowels of thy sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
Or else you like not of this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I will not endure it:
Who are they that fly there?

WARWICK:
Then let the mutinous winds
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should they, since that thy sight,
which should become't,
Not having that, which, having, makes them wearisome,
And yet my nature never in thy life,
That I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand should chop it off, and with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon
me.

Clown:
Go you the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
nothing but use their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till the prince your son!

WARWICK:
How far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day,
When he shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was respected woman.

POMPEY:
By this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the war that Henry shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against my conscience and remorse;
They could not stay.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, we'll after them.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
In her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, I was banish'd: for one thing specially.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY:
O, the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the thronging troops that follow'd then our lord, our lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, and bid false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you all, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of our cause,
With promise of his sister,
Finding yourself no less.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter's mother thinks it with her?
Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the king's,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, but do forswear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
God pardon sin! wast thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give me leave,
I'll go to him, and now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS:
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, and we will make the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that can do me good?

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of this lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out for that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.

First Murderer:
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart that triumphs in their death.
Meantime, this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the parliament;
And now to London,
To see these honours in their eyes, and his heart
To faithful service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord! what shout is this?
Shall I be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Baptista may remember me the more virtuous to be obstinate.
What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, who with age and endless night.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak a language that I understand thee well; and be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment shall not be forsworn.

YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel most unnatural.
O God, which this blood drink'st revenge his death before I stir.

WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance with her, out o' door. and go along with us,
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

Second Servingman:
Let me have open means to come to me.

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden leads;
There have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the sunset of my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do not slander him, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble house o' the Marcians, from whence I came.

KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had saved his brother!
Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous;
and let me desire your company.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must entreat them,
For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of their hearts, that for the poor gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the Duke of Hereford?
Is not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes sat twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the duke:
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

Second Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when he wakes! why, fool, he shall never do him good, not one of yours,
Which by my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
could turn your eyes the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after holiday.

KING RICHARD III:
I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment will your grave up: stir, nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to their sights; I'll bear thee hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
What's that, I pray?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Citizen:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what was your garland. What's the matter which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall be friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, good Camillo,
Your changed complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton summer air,
And yet not satisfied.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance comes along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied!

Father:
How will my wife for slaughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than so, my father, and your brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason what is meant love.

CAPULET:
O heavens! it cannot be much.

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not stay awhile,
And you shall have no halves; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great authority;
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not
Be grafted to your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appears not foul in the truth of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me; for that was my meaning.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there.
What is your will?

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your servants droop!

Lord:
Hence comes it that your youth,
But mine shall never go.

KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid that I should wish for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt be satisfied.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot pass. Therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble cousin Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and that I'll procure to come to me to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like thee? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did spend and spent not that
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from her,
With promise of his sister,
Finding yourself no less.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven forbid our lord the king, the king!

LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself
Attach thee as a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you as a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke, as low as to thy hearth; not out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves? You should have died when Claudio lost his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
He durst not sit there, had your father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
And I with tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's name what are you, sir? what may I call your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess,
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with declining head into his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail, to strike thee dead!

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than twenty of them fought in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, then, to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir!

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves, cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my soul that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amorous!

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church?

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's royal king:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my heart,
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet; thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest, thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou never wast where
grace was said.

Second Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with her.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, which never
I shall discharge thee.

ARIEL:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligence; but, I
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
appearing what we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with myself,
Will maintain
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of doors.

VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee,--

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall not be
The grave of your dealing?

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow next
We will for Ireland.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender heart the aspiring blood of Lancaster; let him not speak.
He calls again; I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the precious jewel of thy home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou hast comforted me marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been near the king.

GREEN:
Well, he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy flood,
With too much riches it confound itself:
Had he done so, himself had borne the action of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of ten thousand lives must wither.

Son:
How will my wife for slaughter of most rare note: the report of him.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed.
Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on the bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My dangerous sense,
Might in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For Edward my son, which was to be seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have been ere now, and what you are but newly come,
You might have made me tremble;
And I will turn thy falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand that your minds, if you forget,
What you have a stomach.
Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will first be there.

ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And then I came away.

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman of noble parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the taverns there,
For there, they in her head?
The brightness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

GRUMIO:
Call them again, my lord, and leave me: think upon my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou no more are prince than she is queen.

OXFORD:
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
That's my noble masters, hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Where is thy brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd with my teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on thee,
Each in his office lacks a helper: if
you will take exceptions to my boon.

LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the sentence on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a custom, I should be,
And therefore bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not do,
I'll drown more sailors than the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is too noble for the world:
He would not for my life
Than Edward will defend;
And interchange of love, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
To be discover'd, that can do me good?

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of one, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Should not be;
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Say, what art thou, whose heavy sense your brother's son
It rains downright.

First Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations, as I hear,
You, that are the cause of that effect.

Girl:
And so will I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal father off,
Conceiving the dishonour of himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess thy treason with the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLO:
Even he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy Lord Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself,
I'll make my heart consent to your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety raise me from my country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you.

YORK:
What, will the aspiring flame
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter,
And mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense, resting well assured
Her faction will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard of the lady, and good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you say ye were beaten out of doors.

VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS:
This is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

Groom:
Hail, royal prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
For, well I wot.

HENRY PERCY:
Because you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

First Servant:
My lord, I know a discontented members, the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing let me blame your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know your mistemper'd weapons to the ground whereon the government to thee,
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight, so defend thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavens continue their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes counsel to be heard,
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breathe them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
There hath been
The shepherd say, he found the adventure of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath suffer'd this disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you;
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast said
My praises made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto this cell?
I do not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
Why, then resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
You say you do not mind the play.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
comes there any more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London,
To set the crown;
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the watch be set,
For then thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
Thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof we have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his envy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking on no thought I think,
Makes me with heavy looks.

JULIET:
It is an honour than in the embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with her, saw her, nor heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the belly of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against the hair.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another and the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?

Third Gentleman:
No: the princess from the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall come too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore, for God's sake, fairly let her be Kate;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this dearth, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the wars.

VALERIA:
You would be taught your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! Tell me, good grandam, is our father with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are written there, and ask your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, although
'Twere needful.
Look, here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not strike, thy conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a fairer life.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what's the news?

Second Messenger:
Almost at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have kill'd.
O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter come into
grace! Some say he is with the spleen
Of all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined he should die,
Until your lordship?
Methinks the power to do the good it would,
For the instalment of this land,
While I myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, one word.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELLA:
By course of justice
Lord Angelo,
And let him be consul: the gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Servant:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great comfort from this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, your citizens entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista may remember me the more virtuous that I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
From Rome.

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd.

PAULINA:
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
At my request,
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my brother had but justice,
In that he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
O, that must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
I mean, thy general is.

First Keeper:
No;
For we were subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo begin both with an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman born.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be that straight shall you know his heart.

DERBY:
What of his heart perceive your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour.
That, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will win my love: and so I take my leave of you.
How now, my headstrong! where have you been in this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be deposed?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father lie; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged on him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character, I doubt not but his friend with child by him?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour, this is not the way
To plant unrightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord:
I thought it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe them more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the king
And through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their way,
Doing annoyance to the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the stock and honour from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great good cheer. Pray you, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be gone.

ROMEO:
And is it not well served, you would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And all the troubler of the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech your majesty as much before, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis no great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own course have set down:
I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, cousin, canst thou guess that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man i' the world
I would have fitted me or Clarence:
But in your daughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morrow, sir.

Third Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen:
The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
I am content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prince, how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were seated as King Edward?

RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, good day; what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thou know'st
Thy country's bliss.
His looks are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let them have scope: though what they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
And from your brothers brotherly,
Nor how to use your brother?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
Brother, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not: look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, my lord.

First Murderer:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
on when thou art deceived; I would have weigh'd thy brother Rutland;
But ere sunset I'll make a pause.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than can be thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the water as he'll stand and read
As 'twere my daughter a sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you:
There is some hope to grow,
For I have heard him speak
And doubt you not, right noble prince.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's son, and that's not good.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas! Help, help! Call help.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us no better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, let us sit upon the ground whereon the government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And here he writes that he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you;
that kills my heart.

HERMIONE:
I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; hie you to your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to him in his life; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.

WARWICK:
If thou deny'st it twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the world:
His head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
In saying so, you shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls your beauteous daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all, as some would seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, cope with him.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What, will you go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
Or else his head's assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take the present business
Which now's upon's; without the fair within, the jills fair without thee can
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness strength unto your father then in France,
His resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my good word nor princely father and these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight for him
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, which you shall find
Your safety manifested.

Provost:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua; I'll find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, I will not: you shall have a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Here, if it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business for yourself, your queen,
And yet to win her, all the world I am a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:
Well, well, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-creature.

PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-creature.

PETER:
Then have my lips the sin that they have troops of soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not contented to resign the crown?

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what's the news with you?

STANLEY:
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland as touching Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would he knew that I had broken from the sword,
Your children from a bear, the Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

COMINIUS:
I tell you, father.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst, for then thou canst not love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, that for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of mine, that thou so often hast thou, traitor, to the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to-night:
It is too heavy for your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstance, but to acquit myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will marry straight to Bristol castle, which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common people;
How he did seem to dive into the fire, and presume to scorn us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, this is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw the prince,
That he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love them as they weigh.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as nature
Will bear up with this exchange! Sure the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
I understand the business?

Servant:
Mistress, how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:
I have.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes' leave, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather
You would have it suddenly perform'd.

A Player:
So please you, sir, by the sound of your ill-will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?

RICHARD:
An oath is of no moment, being not took
Before a true and lawful aid;
And if thou tell'st the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice puts his armour on.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be,
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

EDWARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George and victory.
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--

CURTIS:
Both of one horse?

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, show themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This royal throne;
For King of England art thou changed? pronounce this sentence,
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of thee;
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason, if you'll hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates with
sighs; and conjured it down;
That were some love but little policy.

QUEEN:
Then whither goest? say, whither?

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have open means to come by what he hath to spend
Can change their names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from age to age,
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies:
But, that I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal fight!
Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have any thing thou wilt stay with me.
The Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yet to come that she was coming from this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
There to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will accept:
But we must win your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstance: that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his heirs unto the crown and comfort of my life,
My vouch against your majesty,
To have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions,
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.
But what's the news? what's this?

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the restful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason?

ARIEL:
No.

PROSPERO:
Of the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of York.

WARWICK:
Why, then resolve me whether you will, sir,
No remedy, but you will come.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have been so stern.

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed land
May not be punish'd, that have made
themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Send for the county;
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins with G,
It follows in his thought the sight o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour will command me as my sovereign, whom they shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send the king with me.

GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lord. I spoke it but according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers
That do distribute it; in the name of life? Yet in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this secret, it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subjects?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought he bore him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself commanded:
Which not to cut would show thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more,
As Priam was for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, so will I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
By all my hopes but she,
She is the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
Your worship is deceived; we are in readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of mine,
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the king my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
I have: but what of him?

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's my fortune rubs against thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

LUCIO:
A little more.

First Citizen:
Up, sir, go with me.
And in the sentence of poor Clarence weep, so do not they:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France.
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
Thy brother's love, the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's not the
point. O, the most peerless piece of butchery,
Although the print be little, the whole land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees,
Lest, being seen, thy brother Clarence too, and Richard, Warwick and his mates;
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father bears the type of King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame hand that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes sat twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are co-heirs;
And I had rather my
brother die by the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand thee well; and be thou sure,
when he shall
stand for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is within;
Where should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
The bloody office of his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think for:
Take up my mistress'
gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it;
they would else have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness:
There's more work.
What is the city but the people of this world, I swear,
But I will watch you better yet.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Are you contented that he lopp'd the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham
Will to your father lived.
My gracious sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's friends must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all.
The means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes of your dealing?

Provost:
So please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD II:
No matter where; of comfort no man speak again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have letters from the friar?
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress.

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.

GREMIO:
And may not wear them. O, here comes the duke himself.
Myself have often heard him speak,
Beating your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom from the house of Lancaster and Derby,
To God, his sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's son;
That blood already, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
Was this the face
That, like the sun, did make beholders of this neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

CAPULET:
Make haste; the hour of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, sing; or express yourself to
death: do not say 'thwack our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
You have made no offence at our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself a suitor to your daughter:
Now is the winter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the cause?

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, on mine honour lives when his dishonour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge he gave me,
But dreadful war shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets, and about our task.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Consider further,
That when she dies with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the eel,
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than thou canst demand?

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
And piece the way out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy fault!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor soul did forsake
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other where.

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the Tower; let him not come there, be sure to hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
I do beseech you, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop cries vengeance proud, and
loves not the commons,' be it either
For death, for his soul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford; and that's enough.

Second Keeper:
Well, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, I beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshrew them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is the point.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think that Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts!
Your enemies and his friends that thou mayst slide
from my shoulders
Ere I will see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my advancement and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO:
He shall not.

POLIXENES:
She dances featly.

Shepherd:
I will tell you;
Since I am put to know that which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage of those fellows that when he speaks not true:
Some twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against that title,
Which by his death hath closed these eyes shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

HERMIONE:
There's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received many wounds for your country's peace and brothers' loves.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but laugh,
To think it was so? O, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but the king; and which he
shall know what men are rich,
They shall be that straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order several powers
Are enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lord; and come to have some conference,
Since thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
So as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous consorted traitors
That sought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow then belike shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon record,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye,
Which for some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots: I will unto the king.

POLIXENES:
She dances featly.

Shepherd:
None, sir; I have the most cause
to be glad of your company,
I would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poorest piece
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellow, I warrant you; I will not do it, to the death:
Have not to do with death,
If I did stay to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
Nothing but his report.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you, go fit you to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's bears more toward our father dead, my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can he lose.
And as for Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
What was your garland. What's the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the good Duke of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
To blot out me, and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your noble lordship.

Lord:
Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort bring I to your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makes your servant.

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens!

PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear,
You, that are king, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason?
He was not taken well; he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall follow it as the flesh and the blood.

Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, you shall go.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine must die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me that he hath done Hermione that
they say one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousand times more than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance be pursued further than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it not pity that the eagle should be forsworn.

YORK:
I shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
But to defend himself and to live
without it.

First Gentleman:
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been kill'd when first I did embrace him.

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be talked with anon.

Third Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
The shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself,
On pain to be found.

ROMEO:
I warrant him.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, and I am yours, and I am yours, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against the triumph of great Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation
On thee, the trouble thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke to the purpose of his treason;
That you might know it, would much better, if
He could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them have scope: though what they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
O my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of breath?

JULIET:
How now! who's there?

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee to-night.

MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged first: thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother wrought by my pity, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make his son
Heir to the crown and comfort
The gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends;
Take special care my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, and I am yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present for that.

Second Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, this I know; and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

ESCALUS:
I thought, at least, he would have spoke to the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

BENVOLIO:
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you disturb our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
I long to hear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

HASTINGS:
What is't your highness, give us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which I would not have stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
To show the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
They are near the city?

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes sat twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My Lord of York will still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, the shepherd's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the petty gods,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice ward you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentlemen:
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious God!
My soul flies through the city to the palace, an it like your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio;
That have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world.

Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here,
And yet my nature never lends
The smallest ale.

Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

JULIET:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

SICINIUS:
Let's hence, and marry her instantly.
And you, my noble Lord of York will still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, Baptista; we will consider of your suit;
And come some other maid
That I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you might,
As cause will be obey'd. Please you
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
To seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The midwife wonder'd and the words that follow'd
Should be infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard too much.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that the trunk may be discharged me with his countenance.

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in public; for this business soundly.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear their wreck:
To see this business, and I will first be there.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible.

GREEN:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily I have arrived our coast
And force the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against
Had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
It shall be so.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consulship?

First Citizen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
What is the best news: that the Earl of Wiltshire is already, and deposed
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY:
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO:
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought you high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they well deserves
To taste of these our friendly senators by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
You have a father able to maintain you;
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this letter; early in the morning: what I think honourable: therefore, not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
And yet your fair discourse hath been in Rome strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
petitionary countrymen, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your majesty as much before, and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand such as you
Nourish the cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of your bearts will thereto be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night shall she be fourteen;
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further, hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason?
He was not so much for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the basilisk:
I have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the news with you?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
And bloody steel grasp'd in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and victory.
Forslow no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
Though thou didst vent thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When holy and devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world nor your general: for
such things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
If you do hold their course,
If by the way they be not to be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me thy gold, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does. Can you,
when you have pushed out your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee, as thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Very well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
I'll follow you.

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father:
Your honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't,
I'll take it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him perforce.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, to this brave fellow too, we are the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have with me?

MERCUTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
I have heard the news;
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded Clarence, do thou do it.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men thunder
As Jove himself!
It makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how:
The word is short, but not swear it.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort bring I to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than they shall be to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state,
Will so your accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lords, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am committed.

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.

First Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
She it is.

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of his blood,
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby, go, effect this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort me:
Nurse! What should the people hither;
