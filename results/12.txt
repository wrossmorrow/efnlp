Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not: if she say I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd mould
Wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
What wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hear him plead;
For Clarence is in place.

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
And sent you hither?

First Murderer:
A man, as you are.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twenty caged nightingale:
Say that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo!

HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord?

RICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
The common muck of the world,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his son George's head;
The fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
His dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, that heaven shall share with you.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY:
Nay; I beseech your grace dead, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the blood of English shall manure the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold out my horse, and I will merrily accompany you overtake?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
Your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city
You cry against your suits are stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would beat down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and there
be many that they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, mean mischief and break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what they yielded.

LEONTES:
As now she might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friend Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is a noble gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First Officer:
Come, come, you mock me; this is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the way
To Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what he would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success,
Then 'tis but reason that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition and the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship,
And all their ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance surely like a father you will or no.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give me leave:
My father's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life,--
As I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's he that was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings, the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO:
Why that's my spirit!

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, before it pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you, go fit you to the people,--

BRUTUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
Down with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Good my lords, bear witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee,
Supply me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the touch,
To try if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall know what men are rich,
They shall not live.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the dispositions, if
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear the corse, and set it down.
I tore it from the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's son, and that's enough.

Second Servant:
Why should hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father will not frown.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO:
O, did you so? And do you remember it.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book of life,
And I from heaven,
When I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your hearts of sorrow and heart's discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal party granted once,
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to stables, and his head born to Angelo.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence, George of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, go with him.

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what said Surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never born
to. Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour,
My words express my purpose, I will venture
To save this brother's love!
Come, Clarence, to myself.

GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee
That thou attend me
