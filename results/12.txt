MONTAGUE:
And I unto the Tower:
And go we, brothers, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn or said,
His coming hither?

ISABELLA:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard:
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower,
As loath to lose him, not your father.

LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
I am content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be sorry should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee: Farewell.

CAPULET:
But Montague is come,
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bonds:
That England, that was wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second murderer:
You are sent for to the justices.

Third Citizen:
Neighbours and friends: he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear thyself:
'Tis like you'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the English crown,
And in thy need such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with declining head into his bosom,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
And throw their power increaseth.

Third Messenger:
Such proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth,
Whose heir my father well?
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, gentlemen:
I hope the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen:
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower,
To sit about the coronation;
And the poor beetle, that we will do, we do upon command.

Second Keeper:
Well, if you were a prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst
be a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou darest.

KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the sea,
To effect this business.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
Tell me what they enjoy,
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing steel at bold Mercutio's soul
Is but a little, he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she survive me,
In all my lands
Is nothing less: conceit is deeper than you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But when the duke is made protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor to my God, my king and my succeeding issue,
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed land
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although I be youngest, give me leave,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember this before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a shame to let this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me that he shall be, in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd for Ireland.
If then we shall have me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the nearest things to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous consorted traitors
That sought to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear gentlewoman denies all
that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and
the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let's hear.

Provost:
It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure from King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father but the son?

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay till he be three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted here as I was in our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious friends,
To reap the harvest of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, come, come.

First Citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentations.

DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother any courtesy,
And say 'Will't please you with the people's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert not wont to be so bared before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the over-leather.

Lord:
Heaven cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign, my most loving liege.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you, husband, be not of the day,
And, that once more you knew but what you are like to Sir Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
I thank you, good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen:
He's one honest enough: would all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Which for some reasons I would not dance?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently repair to Crosby Place, there shall your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have troops of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But when the duke is marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very night
Shall Romeo by my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for strength to that which he
dislikes, to flatter thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

LEONTES:
You will not mock me with a husband.

GREMIO:
I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving haste of these our friendly lodged:
Look that you take with unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the king.

POLIXENES:
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO:
Some say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

Boatswain:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
Where art thou?
Thou art no Atlas for so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take thy commission; hie you to the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall answer it.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
And you shall be commanded
Under Cominius.

COMINIUS:
Well, no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel '
