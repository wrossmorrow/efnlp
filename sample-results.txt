FLORIZEL:
We are not safe.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou the tale: but hadst thou be gone?

VIRGILIA:
What then, sir?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Citizen:
Think you my uncle told me they had beat you to your good report I hear of youth doth always loved us well.

GLOUCESTER:
As much good stay with me.
The Earl of Warwick be so near to Hermione hath set a blot upon my brother.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest, thou never shall forget it,--
Of all the men alive
I never yet beheld, desires access
To breathe be well assured
Her faction will be done, good father, I beseech you, sir, 'tis almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
If you head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
Come, sir, along with us,
Or shall we beat the messenger.

EXETER:
My conscience in your clothes? say you so? the gates shall then have at you for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder: myself on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment I did find thee ranging,
Hortensio, peace! thou knowist not what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen
and children yours.

LEONTES:
Didst perceives it is but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee thither:
I, that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross the sea, bring
forth more islands.

GONZALO:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your sweetheart's hat
And pluck the diadem,
Now in his suit he scorn'd you; but your words. Be that your own instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Proof?

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughter Katharina welcomed you with this maid;
She comes to greet you.

PETRUCHIO:
How but well,
Whatever fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the matter being afoot, keep you from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then,--

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see the princess no worse can come to fight:
And weakling, Warwick tells his title honour to be much believed,
the spirits,
Standing before he married to her eyes,
The bleeding the moon that she were gone,
Given to the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer of state, where now we mean to shrink from him.

PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some Paris; and all thy complexion, shall keep the oath that he shall this bisson multitudes, and fearless I to thee and me;
And given to beggars.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he is
mine only son, and that's Richard gone?

CLARENCE:
That he will give you as much as me.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, his own affection.

Shepherd:
They call for dates and quinces in the wreck, which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou leave it,
Without a parallel; those being all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his knees:
Which on my faith in heaven, where they are
past compare,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow, gentle Norfolk: stay by me;
My soul is very jocund
In the remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that time?

First Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, by redeeming him,
Should be! I had rather my
brother did love Juliet,
All slain, all dead.
The king is come: deal mildly with his sword prepared, and the
prisoner to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

First Keeper:
We charge you, that you have me
False to my nature where
My fortunes forth of my company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of yours!
Come, I'll question more:
These high will.

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
Pray, let us share thy thoughts' sovereign, but earth and earth?
Since birth, and hear me speak,
Before you had worn him to this father?

JULIET:
My ears have not yet dived into this pedant:
Methinks I so should tell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL:
It cannot be.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things,
And you tell me that hand that he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto the king doth love you better.

SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' my word, we'll do it through the airy region stream so bright.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and there's my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says your lord's departure, as you know
Prosperity's the very
services thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA:
More to know that, constable?

ELBOW:
If it? please your labour: keep your duties,
As I have discredits.
Here comes a gentleman told somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
Can this dark conspiracy!
O loyal father of the timeless deaths
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
My father dead, my fortunes and my state to liberty,
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Your action.

BRUTUS:
Enough, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the heels;
Thy mother felt more than my dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a servant to
use his master's use.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis a condition can a treaty find
I' the part o' the people, seeking means
To make her good, so were I
A man, the wounds.
O valiant lord, the mind that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
No, pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, let us sit upon a hill, as I do now,
Taking the measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you have touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my deep integrity which shows me mine changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful would have made fault
I' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Why should shame to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford; and that very
distant time stood, as it were the very road into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being over-proud in sap and blood, your flesh
and blood is hot that must be granted that,
Here was 'I thank your good correction mildly, kiss the earth be drunken with our glorious worth of consuls, senators, have you lost a sight, which way thou go'st,
Where it seems hid,
And hide me with deadly hate:
Again uncurse their sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty again
With words that are fallible: tomorrow you must pardon
For Mariana
advantaged, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say; give't to thy cursed self.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night I hold an old accustom'd dram,
That he is a flattering glass,
Like to his father is not all this good news; the ladies of esteem,
Are made already blazing by our meeds,
Should yet absent me from your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury spent, anon
Did this breathing-while,
But you must desire should be the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Our spoils we have sent--

GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cost.
But first I'll do my errand. The good gods assuage thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this face:
As brittle as the glasses you have been so brief to part with the king's ship wreck'd
And his great justice seizes: what know the causes of our enmity!
What traitors' calls and do the like.

LUCENTIO:
I never heard of!

RIVERS:
Then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
This letter.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his face,
And doth it give me with the king, who late hath beat her husband.

LADY GREY:
My mind is changed.
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.

GREMIO:
You may go walk, and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good lady:
You might have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt too much for my poor brother's guard, even there,
Against all
patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and Caliban: foolish woman:
The day is ours, the blood.

Messenger:
Upon the hatches,
Methought the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there the little son?

VIRGILIA:
O, good sir,
You know your face and use you like me, she shall be so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and sleep afterwards 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, dear mother and thy uncle, thou hast advised me.

KING HENRY VI:
My crown I am; but still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio's, to cross to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
And when the special good doth give her the bastard by Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience;
Too little for my country's good,
This noble mother, and
My friend, and comfort
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my death-bed lie,
And you shall find.

TRANIO:
But youth in twain
To sunder his house,
It will outrun you, father,
If you first sinn'd with us and that thou hast, forget'st. This damn'd without counters. Let me see thee here alone.
What is your particularise their abuses in
common houses, I know not what.

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable sort: if my son were my husband; yet my husband--God be with his
finger and his wife
Hear nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I know she is not in their children, but that will be never: tune your instrument.
Therefore prepare to meet.

MARIANA:
Noble prince, a royal king!

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his gracious couple, do: and there an end. But what said Henry's corse,
When scarce thought of, a little further
And to myself I said
'An if a man bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
I yield all this;
But for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband, he is gone; and withal whet me
To be revenged
But by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself art a
wicked villain, that fights by the year, upon that man thou art banished him, we respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, your company.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you be a king'?
Who told me, in the field, and for much more than needful
Forthwith from Ludlow then, for I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and thy steps no more
Than he, and more,
More fearful?

Messenger:
My lord, your promise for the most, become much more: but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have died when Claudio lost his head ere give consent
His master's use.

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so. Farewell.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? I'll have them buzz to offend that I should forget to drink.

GREY:
Now Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's to intercepted thee,
By help of her more potent ministers for them!--
The mouse ne'er shall deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

First Murderer:
And then with kind embracement. Still, 'tis strange.

ISABELLA:
Let me embrace thee in this fardel and box,
which now shall we do?

CLARENCE:
To London, to your honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
'Tis most likely!

BRUTUS:
Come, we will follow
In the main battle, whose parents live, whose persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and great liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

PARIS:
Give me my being and my meditation;
And no worldly suit would have attain'd the child.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life? she durst not sit there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
That sort was well, if it be not so,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
Hath he not hit you miss my sense:
I mean, thy general.

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw them in the heart doth wound,
And his contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PARIS:
Poor soul,
She speaks this in the midst o' the fleet
Which with such a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder's blood the third man that did ever fence the rest,
Whom we have procured
Set down our host. My partner in this case,
To old Free-town, our common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken your increase,
And treasure spent;
And yonder is the best; and
though I am not to stay all together,
And hast thou, according to thy oath and resolution then to fight.

PRINCE:
And for I know she is come even
now. I shall crave your father's hands,
I here bestow a simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, and the drops
That we have heard;
And in it are the Lord Hastings no man might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have ever your good report I hear of you
And for thy maintenance commits his body
Upon a rapier's point,
Made issue from the wall, and farewell. Katharina,
Yea, and much more contempt
When he doth send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable ingrateful,
were to make his way
Under the colours i' the garden leads;
There have money, or
any thing we say:
We speak not you then reported by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home?

GREMIO:
Good morrow to my want of speaking!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress yourself were still in place:
Yea, and much more slaughter'd,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, I charge you, that you shall find those persons with me, and we shall ever return to pry
In what I further shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
No more than man
And after many lengthen'd hours
And added years to live. Do thou but call my resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but modest as the dove;
She is not in the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is it your will?

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me the light: upon thy back;
Happiness court-contempt? Thinkest thou, Hortensio is afeard of your throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution and to be absolved.

Nurse:
It did, it did; alas the day, she's dead; alack the day! he's gone.

Children:
Oh for our father: never make denial;
I must and will not marry her: the ballad is very pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, do not hear it.

HERMIONE:
By this reckoning none,
Come, go along, and see the truth of my spirit!
But was not taken yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis no great ado,--a friend or foe, let him.

First Servingman:
Under this terror from my face,
Else would put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were they are
not in't; but they may work,
All exercise hath been balm to heal their wounds,
My mildness entertain a cheerful disposition,
Your mere enforcement shall then and his son young Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford done to death. Alas, this gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore hurt not: but
your people,
Our city's institutions, and that to the infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unluckily,
That we may praise the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but strain'd to appear before the king;
Then treasons of the world point at poor Katharina!

KATHARINA:
I'll have your
action of yourselves?

First Keeper:
Forbear to fawn upon a nurse,
Too far in years to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertain good comfort,
So happy is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupts him shall not be altered;
Claudio must die at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my cousin.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue, that slanders I forgive a foolish duty call you brother,
Let him not speak to 'em, I pray you, sir, of such childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will none, she gives you thanks.
I would that be?
Either thou art so, there I throw mine eyes,
Contempt and clamour
Will be my bail.

LUCIO:
Do you persuade him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
Most true, if ever I were wilful-negligent, foolish wench!
To the most just law
Now took your brother to be slaughter'd his own son,
The son, the husband and himself,
As well assured Richard's night to him;
And dares him to set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king's friend,
And, madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day; what mean'st thou, that thou art wedded to calamity.
Like an unseasonable man, grew so in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst thou stay not till King Henry's corse.

RIVERS:
A virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen Dick, I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould be taught your duty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world of restless cares:
So that by this intelligent of our intent and your fair princesses can that woe sound.
Where is thy brother's son,
Now, by my maidenhead,
Be mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperate mart.

TRANIO:
No, sir, I say his horse;
Spur post, and get before Easter? with another, this shall free thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard? Richard, I am with the heart, to see you.

ANGELO:
Teach her that wherein she delights have violent ends
And interjoin their influence
If now I court not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown their hands.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, that cruel child-killer.

CLIFFORD:
Come, come, my lord.

LEONTES:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to orient pearl,
Advantaging their own report.

Messenger:
The citizens.

TRANIO:
I' faith, I will serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable,
Thy purposes
With words of heaven,
And by their vehement instigation? Our prerogative: hence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly obey your commissions.

ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should blush
To see your ladyship; well, good Pompey. Commend me to thy lord;
Bid him not fear it, sir: yet you must
change this purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we will hear you tell me true: it shall be reconcile them all.

ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's no remedy.
Come, sir, leave me to walk
Upon the giddy footing of their readiness,
And take you by the hand; but then you'ld wanton with us,
Or shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural,
To be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
Patience, I pray:
Your hand, my love, and I'll be chief to bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHARD II:
My crown I am; but still subsisting
Under your person and your hidden falsehood with a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make an end of this age,
You break into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall never go.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone,
And hire post-horse up to heaven,
If heaven with patience, and he holds vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For in Baptista's youngest daughter,
And mean to make his prey.
Nay, for a need:
A woman's general; who loved him but, like beasts, we
shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like the cap;
And it I will have more care to keep
Than in possession twenty thousand welcome of his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face be the
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth, and you
have not indeed loved
the people.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me stand aloof, and so I take my leave, and thrive!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or fortune comes to woo.
I pray you,
Stand to me in this gentleman, nurse, that bear them hence; I will not hence, till, with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well for them that fears you less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, mellow'd by the second and the white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did confine thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Thy brother
And therefore have I thy consent and fair accordingly.

Provost:
Pray, sir, can you read to her, by the volume of young and old!

Citizens:
He shall no foot upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stands ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou not, knowing whence thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature died;
And here he comes.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

COMINIUS:
When we granted to that act.
But thou art liege-man to us, that thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the heads of too fast growing sprays,
That seem'd in eating him to this end,
He bow'd his natural edge
With profits of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the king did banish their affects with him?

Shepherd:
So she does praise me grieves me to consider that which your honour taste of sweet news
By playing it to me with consented to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble Duke of York.
Thus do I hope to shake them;
And shall I have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Be collected theirs, Marcius,
I have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard! This is the rascal; this is the day that thou must not be full-gorged,
For the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous deeds:
And there an end.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place,
Till thou give joy; until thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
You need not
change your trade; I'll be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:
I must be plucked down in the sun:
didst thou never had scorch'd the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain thereof:
And there die strangled ere my Romeo; and, when I know after who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, I know not, an't like your honour now or never!
But follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--and thus much:
I'll pawn the blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; for it is
A way to make us no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign soil,
This fair alliance that you may know you one Vincentio.

Pedant:
Keep your honour with such gentle sorrow he shook off the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI:
And shall I have with your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford, what satisfaction have
Touching that I must weep.
I took him for the priest
Should ask, if Katharina the curstest shrew.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the goose?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am committed to the court, the gods!

COMINIUS:
So, the good gods forbid!
I prithee,
Supply me with the proclamation, have you to the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
What say'st thou? is it not like the base knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, for then we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which hath two letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
O shut the gates, and
redeliver out to each,
Yet I can make gods forsworn; is it not?

Sheriff:
It is, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from his soul to love each other's face;
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconciled king,
my brother and the King.'
My dangerous things spoke of, and thy belongings
Are not thine own bowels, which doth cease to follow it
and undoes description to do it.
Where is three carters, three-man-song-men all, and left his men:
Whereat the great toe! why the great Lord of Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry but usurps the regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, at once: the cause of his anger.

SICINIUS:
Here comes the lady of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, rather
Let me be thus bold to put you to 't.
I sin in envying his new shoes with old Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
How should hear,--
Nay, and you
have none.

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gale will soon disperse ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
Good my liege,
Pardon me, sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Tell him, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not done well,
To give thee remedy.

JULIET:
How canst thou hatch'd to the world nor your manhood that durst make you guilty.
Go where you may
Enjoy your hope,
And mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the priest let fall the body's members
Rebell'd against me, I'll requite this kind service:
This day those enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a shame? Note but thine and not fear.
But come, you mock me; this is the last: so we will hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius
With the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his place;
I mean, in bearing with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI:
So flies the reckless shepherd knows not but I am sure, thou art said to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady mourn!

Second Servant:
Master, some show to welcome to my tent; and every thing in extremes.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true time broke.
I wasted time, and no less
Than what you hear a play
And frame your majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
That looks not heavily and full of words?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the issue doubted,
Where of the foe?

NORFOLK:
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well;
But, for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserable have no screen between the lists of all advice
My strengths by strength can give thee more:
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
You need not
change your place,
And young affection not gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS:
Not possible. Swear by the duty which
To a mother's son: I'll swear to do this, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Senator:
The people of this from me:
That in the seat of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other daughter.

LEONTES:
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore I came unto your majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not this true bosom.
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the chimney's top,
And dallies with the heavens hear the sentence of poor Clarence out of sight;
And then begin again, and take an oath
To cease thy suit, and leave us here anon, my gentle earth,
Nor with the rest;
And suffer'd me by the vows
We have made him proud with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my soldiers should have sent
me to the rock Tarpeian, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is inferior to none.

SLY:
Am I a lord? and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow.
And see what I can urge against the wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you where you do: if I do, Pompey,
howsoever you have,
Which any print of goodness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their friends.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not be avoided but by the sailors. Thou, my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

First Citizen:
He has our voices; for Your voices I have received, and many more of it?

Page:
My lord, with such provision:
'Tis now dead midnight, and how came you between us.

LUCIO:
Yes, in good time: speak not. Mark a little more.

First Citizen:
We cannot, sir; but I know 'tis none of your mistress,--let my prophecy
Did glad my heart the strongest nerves and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be shall be Romeo.

JULIET:
O shut the gate! O heavens! Spake you not at all.
He is your own; else, you must pardon me, Signior Gremio: I say he lies?

SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not that
Which then I weeping for your foul wrongs.

WARWICK:
Farewell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll plead for you
As for my patrimony.

Pedant:
God save yourself;
Glad that you might have found,
Scaling his presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord, will bear?
For you must
Cast your election.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us sup betimes, before it please your grace,
At our enlargement what are you that I will not disdain.

Clown:
You have to court her at your mind to mirth and merriment.

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more.

Clown:
What have you not?

Gaoler:
Madam, in happy time;
The rather for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua; there to be crowned Richard their king is dead; and Juliet is alive,
For whose dealings have deserved
All tongues cried 'God save Richard, do not recompensed as thought that Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth her daughter
His tears proclaim against the Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerous unsafe lunes i' the love
That I have
not been common in my love,
Is of a king;
Made glorious angel: then, if you be not, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is;
And so shall I not heard thee, that made you melancholy Lord Northumberland,
If thy offences to us
Shall have a lusty widow now,
That she's big with; for 'tis in vain
To seek him there a maid westward rooteth from the state so? No, no, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

First Murderer:
Look behind you, my mother, child, I know a discontent.

KATHARINA:
I care not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, I pray thee, with a love even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you hear a play
And frame your minds,
Preoccupied with what you will part but with that word 'broad;' which added
to the good report than a homely swain;
To sit upon the damn'd, which Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you take your company is fairer than thy land.
O, had thy grandsire got
My careless of your honourable boy!
That lie shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and not our tongue;
One time will come.

ROMEO:
What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA:
Pray now, buy it.

Clown:
Shall I bring them hither straight.

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, that fights by the book of life,
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in haste,
Else, when he's return:
Say, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak with her.

Widow:
Come, mourn with me all this is true? is it most certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes Romeo, here comes Signior Claudio, for your life in this extremity,
This favour with the men, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
'Tis well they are gone.

Chorus:
Now old desire you to church?

CAPULET:
That is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
That I would it were to tell, and his name and the father bears the name;
For queen, and Clifford slain:
And afterward.

ANGELO:
When I was young
And handed love as might become
A kneaded clod; and therefore 'tis call'd for.

First Musician:
An you re us and fa us, you note me?

First Senator:
Therefore should be thus with life:
If I do lose their magistrates.

Citizens:
Down with that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices.

Third Citizen:
We may, sir, in delay
We waste our lights together,
And hast the veriest antic in the world; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to 'The Beggar and the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth I am thy true service he has done, conduct him to the king all, every word deserves
To taste of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my country's foes,
Your countrymen together, did he not?

Servant:
Madam, have I offer'd love.

CAPULET:
Content thee; prithee, call my men, and beat him back again;
I have resign'd his stewardship,
And all goes worse than they whom youth and cause, I would do that had his teeth before I take my leave, and that bred this meeting noses?
Kissing with!

MOPSA:
Now, in good earnest.
How sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing her song and dance.
Thou wouldst be gone to Bolingbroke have pardon to the right Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for we have done. Come, you promised,
Which industry and courage might have kept that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
When I, that censure him,
And all your sword,
Which we more hunt for that vast shore wash'd with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the beak,
Now in the sun:
didst thou not
Usurp the just proportions
Came short of composition.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there a month behind this business are his looks,
Sharp misery had worn it out.

KATHARINA:
That she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes,
With reeky shanks and use. But I do bend my knee with thine eye! see, see what trumpet 'tis that sound.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians,
The grass whereon these woes shall see this bastard's life,--for 'tis as easy
To make her good, so were you. Was not your countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of that worthy work perform'd.
What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease, Heart's
ease:' O, an you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it is: I wonder how the king's ship; in the deep tragedian;
Speak and look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd it for, he needs will have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Where is thy crown.
What mutter you, or what you have told this slanderous coward and abysm of time?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingness will go.
I would the scandal to the fire, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and the golden time I look for!
And yet, amen, if heaven with lightning in the air
And more a friend.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What stay had we but Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with words that are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of Capulet's
Sups the fairies. This Volumnia
Is worth of my command,
Which thou once didst bend against the duke as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou darest.

LORD FITZWATER:
If that I could dig his grave?
And who should say
My tears shall wipe away these bloody hands
Throw your mistress;
Say, I command the captain and
all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eyes at once see good and bad, that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seeming lady and
Her brother is the worst that must be
so: ever your good prayers for the Duke of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford too,
Have chid me from them, and not thy knee,
Because she will be woo'd;
Therefore art thou king, and yet you halt not.

TRANIO:
I thank thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Whither?

KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death.
Here in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignorant of what I have turn'd your soldier, so,
To have what we will keep the prince,
and wouldst as well as I had seen and one in blood establish'd
The people know't.

FLORIZEL:
I not purpose and our concernings shall be done, my gracious uncle, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
What talk you
Of Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless Burgundy to England and his treasons for this forgiveness.

Provost:
I am your good;
Whereto if you'll hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
The king was I press'd forth;
My father hath no further;
So doves do peck the eagle should have temporizer, that
Canst with thieves;
Rescue thy mistresses! which of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night or in the morning
See thou deliver it to my face.

PARIS:
That may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening cloud,
That, all-amazed, the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere i' the wrong he did us all,
And all things fairly.
And shows good husband now, Pompey; you
will give you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not my griefs; still am I king? 'tis so: I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord Northumberland,
Come, make him an example.

Clown:
Comfort, my liege; remember well
The very mould and frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGELO:
Always obedient subjects; being now a subject,
I have a brother
Of gracious sovereign speaketh like himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid your grace.
Strike the proud tops of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk for life or death.
Those eyes of mine
Or fortune given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

ANGELO:
Condemn thee to thy brother:
Were he more angry at it.

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord. My suit is at an end.

BAPTISTA:
Content thee; prithee, give no limits to my tongue dares not, that, I think
You have in manner with your gossips, go.

Nurse:
I know not--'Sdeath!
The rabble should be. Let me see; what a man are you!

ROMEO:
Alas, that love, whose parents live, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking it,
Break too.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus
He would not, he had not either
delivered the matter?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair an eye
As Paris hath set up his rest,
That you take your honour with you.

Provost:
It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you did.

KING EDWARD IV:
To tell your lordship drink a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be so; since he hath
Served well for them
As I can say nay to thee,
Thou setter up and puller down of kings, this scepter'd office of your blood
Could have shed my blood,
Nor thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
I confess to you than
any, freely give thee half,
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden: learn, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant that is not Richard's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befal thee, good Bianca,
For I will not let me speak.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been made, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to challenger.

HENRY PERCY:
There stands all your victory.
Forslow no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George and victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and gentlemen! come, musicians have express his disposition,
Hath made him send Lord Hastings had pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which they did hear of Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts
Should well agree with our royal ear abused. First, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ them all;
Commend thee for my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have with her that's gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
Madam, if't please your honour have.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence yet hanging in the hams.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou in my stead, would you have, or I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
I pray you all, tell me where I
may find the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was now your pleasure.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET:
We follow thee my loving lord, I take my leave of these men.
Bushy and Green
Observed his hate,
And they shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own misfortune is befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the ground,
Ye favourites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with that surname; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the next way home.

Clown:
Go you to Angelo.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish thee to the very wreck that we must win your grace have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of which he spurs on his powerful, think it,
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will not let me see the world nor your manhood that durst swear at your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your face,
Dismantle you, and, as I guess,
Upon the sweetest flowers are slow and weeds make the perfect period of tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kind embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement immediately.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what news?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO:
And then?

BIONDELLO:
The better than the male.
But what's his offence?
There's magic in thy majesty, which he has put upon
me.

Clown:
We'll have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with our blood:
I'll kill my horse, and I will do't, sir,
Please you, sir, he tells me we shall shine on me;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
What, sovereign's hand,
And let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, sir, accept of it.

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant loyalty,
By all my hopes are but as thought,
March'd through, not without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You are like to him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, best know,
Whom I believe thee; for I do feel it gone,
But know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you that chances here:
Give me my sin again.

ANTIGONUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's go: one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which I fear some ill;
Move them not?

LADY ANNE:
Villain, I'll speak of all the parts of that receipt I had forgot that name was Antigonus,
I charge thy sulphur with a band of thine;
Thy place is famous isle?

CATESBY:
God keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a messenger of heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more a happy days.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way to kill a wife with me to make a stale of me amongst us, save your honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

MARIANA:
You have hearing a
cause between your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this my life-time reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland comes before him: our general ignorance,
And he, that villain madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
call ladies.

SLY:
For God's sake, speak comfortable friar! where is no soul--
No, not so much is the return and I can never be of what I hate the idle pleasure I shall interchange of thy throat;
And wish, so please you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence,
Before thy kingdom cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
As, though on thinking on them,
To make you friends,
And say 'What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
What news, in this one is one too much,
Unless my hand and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which, but by being a bawd? What
do you think fit to furnish me of reason. They are rising.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
Tell not me:
I knew she were!
She speaks:
O, speak not a word? you take eggs for money by exchange
From Florence and my soul.

ANGELO:
Good night to your daughter Katharina,
And thou, brave Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green, and they
Stand in the duke so well as I,
Or felt that pain.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your duties,
As I have lost myself; and see how one another? What's the matter,
That Lucentio loves:
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not too heavy for your country quitted
With those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant:
Will't please you, great sir,
Bohemia greets your highness' soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the instrument of the table and shall be drawn out all in vain comes counsel to his ears?
Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her hence in haste,
Else, when he shuts up his windows, locks far daylight doth a lamp; her eyes were made to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a bear, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd Troy.
But Hercules;
And let his manly face, which she yet
wears for his father revell'd in our parliament pledge for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder you.

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

QUEEN:
Give me the glasses of thine enemies;
And when I give occasion speaks thus their voices; for Your voices blended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are most welcome!
And your fair prayer
To have it prest
With more of this. What, ho! my lord!
What cheer? how is't with your crown!

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the steely point of honour,
Lest she should bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to maintain I would not have made fair word;
Nor cheque my eyes from rest;
For I have often made against him.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

BRUTUS:
Well, no more.
Pursue him to his legs.

ROMEO:
Commend me to him:
Tell him from his hands,
To hurl upon the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of peace! I hate the murderous knife was dull and heavy eye,
My tongue will tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self-place where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me heaven!

Lord Mayor:
See, where he
is to behold
Our cousin lay to Mowbray's spear:
As confident to speak with her.

Widow:
She shall, she shall be such
As, walk'd your first: or if it did not,
Your first order died,
And thou no more.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your foe,
A villain that is hoar
Is too much my friends.
Ourself and all the church o' Thursday let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES:
This is most likely 'tis for a
good purpose. Therefore, let's away; the strangeness of it.

Keeper:
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
As far as Calais, to mine uncles and myself and these bars
against me of this plain.
Let's march without impediment;
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's blood the thirsty evil; and when be married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears! I am yours for this once. What, have I choked you with so strong a fine
That you have banish'd Hereford's right,
By this I challenge nothing else to ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen:
Should be in the common people;
How he did seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
Ay, and the thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
Gentlemen, will you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, nor England's ground?
But then up farther, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness betide my liege,
You cannot guess wherefore be patient till the heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my wife,
Save that riotous youth, with danger and dishonour
Than at the sight of day,
But self-affrighted you;
I promise, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, doubt not that, my liege; why looks your grace
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear their wreck:
To see this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the man lunatic?

TRANIO:
Fear you his tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice puts his armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory from thence the child,
Told the sad story of my father's of a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and your love pursues
A banish'd runagate doth limp?
O slanderous coward,
As thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
I like it well that our noble father-in-law and the abbey wall:
Within this hour bring me in the face:
Speak not for him.
My lord, will't please thee,
But that I want love.

VALERIA:
You would have weigh'd thy brother, when she dies with my
habit no loss shall touch the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the street, because he would have filed keys off that worthy
Coriolanus must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing come in partial. Sir, he must not die
Till George be pack'd with France.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, and knock are too powerful
on the high'st degree
He hath abused your worship will take thy words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father York
Bless'd his three sons with his enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No quarrel, I will win my wager better thing that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from his father's fault,
And long live thou art suborn'd against him first to keep him here
Our certain dregs of conscience tells me that, if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
My lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord: would it were they not mine?
Did they not,
Well might the vantage of the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And with satiety seeks to make love to her:
Plead what I was;
The flatter--
That's thousand in this fair corse; and, as I guess,
Upon the sister to my wife. I'll return to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou livest,
And then betwixt me and one Baptista's youngest daughter,
But rather for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave you to seize and gripe into your tongue to such companions, is all ready?

CURTIS:
I call them pillars that will not
Be grafted to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POLIXENES:
I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Citizen:
Therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate bay of death, though no physician;
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Forget, forgive; conclude that he hath something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome every one of these quarter'd slaves!
What, do you tremble? are you lords o' the city
is risen: why stay we now? These soldiers: doubt not her eyebrows?

First Citizen:
It was a bare petition granted them?

Messenger:
The noble Duke of Bretagne
With eight tall ships, three thousand crowns;
Another thinks it with her dowry please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, will your husband's lands I freely speak thy mind; thou dost,
And then to glance from her borrow'd flaunts, behold
Thy sly conveyance and true in me.

RIVERS:
What! lack I credit?

First Servant:
Dost thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon things precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be virtuous maid,
And how shall we to this vault to die, and lie with thee
And wish his mistress.

LEONTES:
I think you then.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet methinks your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
Upon his visage, and thankful sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall I not hear him? You are to know
If yet her brother's life.
Wrath makes no conquest of itself.
Ah, would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
His princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt joy and sorrow wept to take life
From this world frowns, and Edward shall be
The fresh green lap of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this is he that drinks all night,
and I will follow instantly, and tell me,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled Tybalt from his father will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna
Live in thy tongue as in my thoughts:
So smooth his fault,
And not without my food,
Whipp'd and torment me thus?
This torture, from this time.
What, is my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
Well, your imprisonment
And see how one another.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good madam, pardon me, lords, and hear me speak.
Come quickly, I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this king by the violet in the market-place.

BRUTUS:
He consul!

Citizens:
To the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were, from the dead.

PAULINA:
Will you undo yourselves will hear it, sir: yet you must
change this purpose.

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comfort, whose advice
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
It is yours:
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are best inclined to sleep; 'tis a good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
And why so, my lord; I do confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace to pardon
When it was for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious lives,
For 'twere as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at you, sir.

Citizens:
Down with the same give pardon of your beards deserve not worse than a theft, no less terror than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
That die unmarried, ere they lie, and tears and ne'er be younger.
Now, brother Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love your child so ill,
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, then, of Stanley? what will you stay
Till you dismiss the people of this most grievous plague injustice.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to resolve me now;
And what shall pen thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy sovereign in the western side is with thee!
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be burnt and dried away; and, which, for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the bran.' What say you to Thursday?

PARIS:
My lord,
I dare my life must end.

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
That last is true; therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
So many years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have beaten him too.

First Servant:
Will't please you, lords, for Edward my son, which was to be seen,
cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
I do not, make the base earth from the traitor's foot,
To prove my occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians! why,
You grave but reckless shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him call me rogue for being Richard in his timeless end.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the hollow earth.

First Murderer:
Who made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord.

LEONTES:
Hast thou been meek, our title to the crown; meaning indeed his household servants fled with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since mine eye and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister correction to the morning
Desire the like upon thyself?
Thy brother, take my rest;
So many days:
O, by this unholy braggart, a
rogue, a villain
And have forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king,
And wet my cheek
For that my staves be sound, and not the object cheer your head.

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on sudden haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou canst make
No excuse current, but to make the jest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, that is not Richard's royal kings,
Fear'd by their vehement instigation,
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our knees, and all.
Good man, the wounds.
O valiant lord, the army of the queen is spotless reputation to
A savour that may fully discover all
The unlucky manage of unruly jades.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like a cunning instruments of mighty strength,
And in Apollos name, his oracle,
Thus by Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well content you, go to him.

KING RICHARD III:
What sayest thou? wilt thou, O God, fly from my countrymen are gone to join with Richmond, in those where I expect most love!
When I have more lives
Than drops of tears:
Come home to ye!--you must return and tell my lady I am gone for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument alone;
Within these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it folly
To keep your honour means.

Lord:
Thou hast heard me speak with me, I have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used with fear and mutiny
Shall here find his friend, ay, his unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings, love lord marquess.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for me
Richard, enough; I will be, not what to thine oath,
I will be gone.

ISABELLA:
This gentleman! the wrong
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with his guilty head.
Go, bear them living.

LEONTES:
O my brother's life.
Wrath makes him false; he speaks not like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now, mistress, and Petruchio, go thy ways; the field
I'll see them.

LUCENTIO:
What, all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the foaming brine and quite lost their heirs, God, if thy will be thy death,
No word to save your majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore enjoy it now:
By giving liberty unto thine eye begins to speak; my pains are quite forget their loves and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest house-keepers.
What are they that went on
crutches ere he was the chiefest soldiers;
If you do free your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against you, and how I replied,--
For to a vision so apparent likelihood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised,
As lively painted as the deed so far
To know the cause of my son Paris' love?

JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

BONA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that wore them, the souls of men
May deem that yoke so well I love Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio, shall I no whit be behind;
For, by your first is death, and make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which owe
A moiety of the one, it must needs wake you; Lady! lady!
Alas, alas!
Why, all the world:
My soul to heaven,
Since I have ever follow'd thee?
Decline all this present shame;
If no inconstant
And damnable fellows, if they live, to account then Margaret, and tell him of that house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with the lampass, infected
with the forehead
of the morn,
No nightingale, and not I:
When I was a kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why so, my lord.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have been a mouse-hunt in your houses of resort in the commons will not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
It may be so, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
That fellow: I would fain have said,
Stand by and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave us to cure this cause betwixt our Bohemia bend, to signify, that
craft, being richer than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you are welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle but a nettle but a nettle and
The fraughting souls within her scope of justice
Lord Angelo, have still appear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself--
This day she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the best, and what with our love,
And little look'd for from you, Catesby,
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens do ope,
The gods, not the punishment in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one that lives!
If ever he have wife, let her appear,
And he shall this speech be spoke withal.
Here comes your ghostly father's bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder's blood open it again:
He is a kinsman.

YORK:
And there receive we from our quiet confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the nightingale: look, love, what envious siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with the rest,
When we shall have the mustard,
Or else depart; here all the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's wondrous strangers all are gone.

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
There's time enough too?

BRUTUS:
All tongues cried 'God save Richard, dost thou wring thy hands and not offend, nor were not bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
You say you
have not in abundance; our
sufferance. Answer me to-morrow's vengeance of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my captive state to title of your art!

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, you jest: but have you untimely lay
The noble duke hath been in Rome strange nature, letting it up to fear the sentence then,
You have to-night?

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the hope of Troy
Against to-morrow, in mine opinion, they do prank them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff; and you slander of his fair demands,
Nor posted off their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good old folks,
how the younger free
For our affairs,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and tell my lady I am gone for ever earn'd a royal husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
Master, master, read you? first resolve me now;
And many strokes, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have done to my niece?
Did I impale him with his head! Now, by Saint Paul,
I'll make an instruments that feel it.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as they did refuse
And cannot say 'tis superstitiously,
I will be here proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous;
and let me hear
What you can, my false brother
A merriment.

CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of your own seeming; that you might.

LEONTES:
How blessed be the house of York
Unto his princely nephew, brother Clarence:
But then more 'why?' why have they sent it for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant your honour's reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue
And bids me; now I will unmask.
This is a poor epitome of you convey him to the crown; meaning indeed, that baes like a dream to-night.

BALTHASAR:
I dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman.
Let me embrace with quick and in mine ears?
Have I not told thee how to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
I fear me, not to hear a word till now? forswear themselves as often beat for barking
As therefore he sends you word
He dreamt to-night thou shalt ne'er return.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
And were I any thing the image tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years; a silly time
To make prescription to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir! here, sir.

LARTIUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
O general,
I have a servant comes with me? Beseech you, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, and say by whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling scold:
If that I could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
How now! what's that to me
More than thy kindness I owe you
a good turns.
Signior Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

First Citizen:
When clouds appear, wise men have read
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have caught extreme gusts will blow out the
intended fire your city; I now came from Edward's children? wherein dost thou mad?

ROMEO:
Nay, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
I have done the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sentence plaining comes too late.

LUCIO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
And I did yield to his countenance her.

CURTIS:
There's thy reward: be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord: and fear
Of the queen,
That led calm Henry, though mine enemy a lasting war.

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my thwartings of your suit;
And some will mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Camillo is
A federary with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom,
As being well content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; the duke
Dare no more importunate:
'tis a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper'd weapons to the sourest and most contrarious quests
Upon thy tongue that moves, none, none i' the Capitol. 'Tis thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment till
Mine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter with your leader.
Why, then you jest, and now by present to her--as sometime Margaret,
Sit down with him,
He hugg'd me in his face?

ESCALUS:
How know you one Vincentio; my dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall be married to no man but prophesied revenge for me
Richard, be Duke of Clarence, Henry, and regard them not, and all his brother and the tailor with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the noble Duke of Gloucester!
And the queen of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his country, our dear lord Clarence; this is true, father, in the ground,
Ye favourites of a king become a soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue of mine,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any other but Lucentio and his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for man or maid of Montagues, and not valiant, wise, and, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you are!
These fifteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their own lives in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond is their god: he leads the way.
Lords, to the marriage, and we prosper well in this noble duke
In the seat o' the body rich;
And as the subject held the
duke had crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note us.

Second Servingman:
But when we have found easy fines: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

POLIXENES:
On, good Catesby, to thy lord;
Bid him not fear the sentence then and how much
he hath eaten: they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have lived to kill a friend than e'er an enemy's hope,
Who strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were, doubt not but
Our Rome hath such a bloody piteous corse, a bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood.

MONTAGUE:
And I unto the king your friends repair to Ravenspurgh haven before the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who see it;
I will be angry: what hast thou forgot the reward.

First Senator:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
What work's, my country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the little blood which I have been studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin, and others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else to make good
What I have, your noble tribunes, hear me but one false glass,
Which grieves my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become of me?

POMPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a fellow is a fellow is not to me she speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy face,
What thou seest me mask'd; for thy repeal, we shall be,
And, though she chide as loud
As thunder with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would have attain'd the beauty off from an anointed king at nine months old.

Third Gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Paris but at nine months old.

Third Citizen:
Give you good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver him!

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no breeching scholar in the skies?
Have I not told thee how to curse mine enemy hath been as sugar,
Making them women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this gear?

First Senator:
Marcius, I had rather glib myself thy mortal foe:
Matter of marriage of
the king's brother with all
certainty to be the
great rich Capulet; shall go hard if Cambio go without any honest
man's voice. Gentle Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to thee,
he would make up vows: and, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day, fellow; I can read
waiting-gentlewoman, and thy bed,
And graced thy poor devoted suppliant makes this change?

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie! no thought is content:
Mother, I am like you, sir,
Remember since you will have matter thus; mere weakness which nature shows above her breeding, and any
thing that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday is to-morrow in
your execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise shall, by the disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct thee in my weary neck,
And leave his lecture will be
justified in our loves; for if our virtues
Lie in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, is gone to meet you on the way.
O heavens!
I am the young swain seems to be the king unto the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, triumph not in my time
wore three-piled piece, I warrant her, she shall purchase your spice.
I'll be a candle-holder, and look unto them all:
To-morrow will it please myself.

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As it is here set down.

LADY ANNE:
Where is the rascal knaves with weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that when he took a beggar to his bed,
And this the face;
For then she never look upon thy death.
King Henry light.
O Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for defence!
I will away towards me, and says 'God send me no need of many orisons
To move the people?

Citizens:
It shall be friendly senators and patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as becomes you.

GRUMIO:
Katharina,
And thou usurp'st my father fair!
For such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
What now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we thrive, promise that you have slander'd it.

JULIET:
I gave thee life too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the time more benefit and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione hath done
By sight of my revenges to yourself, or else
triumphant garlands of, and my sweet boy
Thy brother battle;
With whom my soul I mourn for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with my wind when I have most need to grieve
At knowing of thy life too soon,
O' Thursday next,
To go with us; speak fair: you may stay;
For I repent me; read not my name there
My mate, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of tailors,
To study fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore thou didst love so dear a loss!
Alas, I am not coop'd here for God, his king and Mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up as best becomes none but thou. Take it up for
pity: yet I'll pause;
For I am he am born to this, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
'Tis true:
If he were convey'd
Shall in despite, I'll cram thee with my masters! have you no countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the shame-faced Henry, bear him to the door.
A beggar begs that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light,
We are inforced pilgrimage;
Then let me die.

PAGE:
This is that faced and braved me in thy company.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have this crack to be in my dread lord,
I should become't,
Not having the power of Warwick, Edward dares, and take his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly clad in arms,
Both who he is and why he left your counsels and the bleared sights
Are spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their love
Lies in their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not know what men are moulded out of it.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that Shore's wife hath a pretty fool,
To see if any mean to take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know that Englishman alive
With whom the Kentishmen will willingness pronounce the steep Tarpeian never more remember. There is our cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right that, I tell thee who I am.
Good lady,
No court in these conflicts
What may be determined respite of all.
The means that heaven finds means to break his law.

Second Keeper:
But, if thou darest.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well see't. Come, let's go.

MENENIUS:
For one poor and loving shout
Argues your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Stay a little door
Which from the ground of treachery is here!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou thrive, if thou be a king, where is he?

CURTIS:
Let's hence,
And he supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourishes his blade in spite,
To be full like me: yet thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot my part, I'll resign unto your majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself,
And see him stamp thus, and call Edward king and not before my face to all occasions.
I'll drown your exclaims,
To stir against thy better disposition better ere he go to church o' your back; and
then come back again;
I have reserved I by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune till
These wars determine of the prison, call to him;
let him have known to the soldiers shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman,
Of these Plantagenet embrace her for her keeping your
greatness back?

Second Gentleman:
Claudio to prison, where they shall know we
have strong and ready for this designments
In mine own again; 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your hands?'
Some one be ready with a dame of France, but a certainty. Yet since I saw the princess my sister should the good gods,
I'ld with the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO:
My lord, I would it were to give again.

ROMEO:
It is my fashion, when I shall gust it last. How came that widow in?
widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon.
Come, leave your blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I am forth,
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE:
What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you, sir, look in this good news; the ladies like a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so she yields to me;
For I, too fond, might have
broiled and eaten him like a portly gentleman.

Third Servingman:
'Tis the way to lay the citizens and friends: subjected thus,
How can you so--
Be the attorney of my love,
And give thee armour that is the matter?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands;
And ere this, but that I know our mind.
What, go you toward the second and the women on to slander, sir, what answer me one doubt,
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save your life
And choke your good wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS:
I do not sleep, Hortensio, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with devilish slave, by thee.

GEORGE:
If so thou thing!
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
I ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, madam.
Take all myself.
How now! what's the news?

Second Citizen:
Woe to the people! Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my servant spend all at
the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide thee, if with the judge's robe,
Become them with us, the honour of his usual pain?
Then give me leave,
I'll muster up your men,
And over the chairs of justice
My patience to you,
Where he was like to find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese: you are condemned lord
Is doom'd a prisoner nine years old.

MIRANDA:
There's no hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night,
Went all afoot in summer's dust with showers of bloody wars,
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been long studying how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune given me measure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced so many follies,
And make us lose the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know it begins with G,
It follows this?
How prettily and aptly taunts himself:
And, for the best.

MERCUTIO:
Without her, follows this?
How prettily the younger free
For me as for a camel
To thread the gates of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name are slain on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what thou hast to deny 't. Come, madam wife, they say, it were not night.
See, how she prayed,
that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father's sake.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, none, but did usurp;
And thou, Lord Hastings: let them tell thee, daughter,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter; and then the prince and beggarly;
Yet, as the rocks cheer them that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation through the world
I would he had.

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yet on summer's ripening breaths.

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that got it, if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous maid,
And how shall we to this princely Richmond and Elizabeth her daughter. Good Paulina, the great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman so hot,
As he will compound this unnatural,
To bend the father; and then marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
When you are come, supper served up, you
called, my young rover, he's
Apparent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they
are.

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say there is no more of this. What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but nature should this Angelo had never seen thee stem, and the moveables
Whereof I shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee again.
And yet I know thou wilt, swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that name befits my composition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
And from this time, had the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.

JULIET:
It is, it is no little thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from hence,
To help to get the crown his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my father is arrived in Padua, but of all
My best beloved any where I have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow let's be gone.

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of him?

POLIXENES:
You tempt him to any thing.

BALTHASAR:
I brought me;
The precedent,
Should a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, and shall be
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The white sheet bleaching on the lines
Of my boy's face, methought, I then was thy birth to me;
For I am loath:
I would have had earnest: but I cannot brook the accent of thy mother's name is little prating York
Was not inclined to hear you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute power,
I say, bid come before we need his helm:
Besides, he tells you flatly what his
mind is: Why give him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
I bless the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and dried away; and, which is another man's
will;'tis strongly
As words come from Padua and here
looking out at the wind that profit us. What, ho!
They are as children, butchers! if you be men. Gregory, remember,
Since once he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
Pluck'd from off the battle; swearing Jack,
That they are louder than
the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that moves, none, none i' the state when Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the name of death to any he that utters them as he had eaten ballads and all.
Good man, the wounds.
O valiant lord, the mayor then and sequent death
Had been more mercy, to its own protection of their deaths thou shalt hear it: to have a stomach.
Will you buy and sell with groans.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The County Paris,
Thou hast the one half lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a soldier of us all.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, for I know the sound that tells what hour to-morrow;
To-night she slept not, nor to-night thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou the king with tenderness, and I would thou wouldst else have died when Claudio lost his fellows,
I'll follow you.

Clown:
He seems to be of great Bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? must we part;
Be merry, for our country's foes,
Your country's cradle
Draws the sweet silent hours of grief, more than death?
Condemned villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how to curse mine enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucester, at Saint Alban's to intercepts my expedition be my friends, God wot;
For then this land was fair before! I have purpose
To put you to 't.
I sin in envying his new shoes with old Vincentio! now we are
gentlemen.
O Thou, whose heart to thee,
Which thou hast beat me out
Twelve several powers
Are enter'd Troy.
But Hercules;
And let them begin.

GREGORY:
They must take it up,
The mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown be weak,
As may appear
At large discourse hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling at themselves all men of hair, they call the qualities o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping and waking, O, defend me heaven!

Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befal thee and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham's army is dispersed by tempest:
Richmond in the common people swarm like summer flies;
I and ten thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the next way home.

Clown:
Fear not, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, we'll dance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me assurance,
She is the hope of Troy
Against their will. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,
Before I beseech you, mark it well.
'Tis since the earthly, no nobler,--whither do you for him: would I wash my hands
Of this most wise rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know who speaks to thee?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the time that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, I think
You have mine action on the proudest of you allegiance unto Henry.
My noble uncle, I beseech your grace speaks yet she says nothing: but what you shall have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, I have of
thee thine own life,
The best and wholesome act
established against myself:
Now comes the wanton stings and Sir William Brandon,
And your fair dominions,
But tread the path that the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

KING HENRY VI:
How will my wife for slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced there.

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! I am none of his greatest enemies,
We follow this feather from thy soul's love didst thou none;
For this afternoon, sir? well, I must wait,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for that thou mayst slide
from my shoulder will I withal endow a child of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord. I spoke it but according. Thou'rt condemn'd by the Duke of York, to know what I know, my house with me: upon a true contract by deputy in France
And cloister enter
And the Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although
'Twere needful.
Look, here comes the woodcock with the king's,
To go with us unto the Tower,
And driven into despair.
One day too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, though but bastards and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million.

BAPTISTA:
And yet salt water thrown away in water-drops!
Good king, great king's daughter mine,
While counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever I were wilful-negligent, foolish and fearless I to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not prepared great store of parting tears.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father's court? for thou shalt not have.
I am a gentleman:
Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, your company.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.
He cannot, sir, we are undone, lady, we are undone a man of mine,
And not provoked by her slanderous tongue; let them hence away,
From Richard's hand
And steal immortal part with habit, I am strong-framed, he cannot
Believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king did banish thee,
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfort from this churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of hands, with countenances.

SICINIUS:
He'll never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen, you do me shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would she kill herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than his.

WARWICK:
Who should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and noble gentleman of mine,
Cunning in music we have stay'd here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with thee by changing.

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen,
Do me but right, and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

Roman:
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it;
But, since it would not be satisfied withal. Away with him toward the mark of others,
But mantled in your city Rome,
I say it is the blessed gods
Purge all infection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is another comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO:
It is not his name: if he be a
married man approaching here,
Which never
My life may last to answer, you might pardon him that hath once broken from his father's goods are all Kates, and follow Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not.

EXETER:
But when goes this forward?

Third Gentleman:
Who would believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased my father's love in banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's queen.
And you shall have a stomach, to bear up
Against the Duke of Gloucester and your humble wife
May show her face, and the law upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them have
That mercy does.
If he had been still a happy king, my brother.

LEONTES:
Traitors!
Will you not proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you two
have not deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham, seal thou this day in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Villain, thy own hand yields the cedar to the town and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice when you part.

POLIXENES:
This is a happier and more than all I have; yea, and his
name is Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
How now, good father.
This island girt in with the
maids, and cut off their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
What is his name?

VINCENTIO:
I would not take truce with the first,
And therefore ha' done with the maid: my mind promise them success and favour.
O Margaret,
With this young prince.

HASTINGS:
Good morrow to you both.
We have made worms' meat of me: I have it here about me, that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than my poor life must end.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else by:
Richard and to me;
And as I truly fight, defend me still!

Ghost of HASTINGS:
Why, knows not that?

GRUMIO:
I confess to thee,
For in Baptista's eldest daughter,
And, by all likelihood of his amendment,
Are come to our account.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, this great affairs;
A weeder-out of his present hour,
Even for thunder;
Nothing but what is left, to lose it, and beat him back?
Where are my children.

KING RICHARD II:
If thou deny, their blood upon your daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how this foul deed were good!
For now they kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base humility,
Which fear, not revenge his death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my noble fellow, I warrant to execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his follies,
Will never speak of would offend again.

DION:
I shall disprove it. You forget
From what a torment I will free your children's voices,
Strive to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our blood,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive me,
Marry, and did; but if you ever to our bones.
For God's sake, lords, and hearing when children are even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill him, having a warranted cousin!
We'll make a lip at
the physician;
Deep malice makes too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their heads shall pay the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Alas, that Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, my lord of Buckingham.

QUEEN:
So longest way shall have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA:
Here's a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all the house.

POMPEY:
Why, very well appointed
This conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty to our presence; face to foot
He was a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with the dearest mother, and look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be very kind, and a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, he in time may serve: for present comfort in the silver sea,
Which serves as paste and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch off Bohemia forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on the head, and set it down.

LEONTES:
I think she will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience!
The statue of her own.

CURTIS:
By this we gather
You have mista'en his colours much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, to the rock with his friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what should be our king:
Yet hasty marriage: when and where some two days buried.
God grant that Warwick's youngest daughter.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I enjoy, being their loan with interchangeably set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, will you go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is meet so few should fear to die? Therefore, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Only fair speech.

KING RICHARD III:
Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath no shriving work in hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, we must enter in,
For hither straight,
For I have bought it were as virtuous deeds:
And then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends
Blush that the weakest goes
to the walls
With painted imagery had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would divorce this terrestrial ball
He fires the prince.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reason serve
To make thy weapon, till thy bloody sheet?
O, what may I call you this:
I have had feeling of my suit,
If that be jest, then all the honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
I do not love to lie and play on;
Not like to hang by the way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow was fought in your Coriolanus.

Officer:
If he did not mock us.

Second Watchman:
Ay, but thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold
bed, and was suitor first.

TRANIO:
He is my father,
Will you go yet?
Force me to keep and kill the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence! one word 'banished'?
O friar, that trembles, sighs and weep.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord. How brooks your grace, which seems a little while be deaf,
Till I have to love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll sup with me?

HASTINGS:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do, I was wont
To load my she with a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of came into this break-from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man here he is.
Hark ye, your Rome embrace with quick and in mine ear.

ARIEL:
All hail, my sovereign,
And made Verona's ancient knot of danger is the wonder in extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and your fair princess, say you, with all due expedience
And see it in thy sex
To triumph, like an execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not my gait in it the measure of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen! ladies that have minded you
Of what you have power in ourselves, our wives,
Your wives dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own humour.

GRUMIO:
Master, it is no boot,
And place your father:
Your honour is account, he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom will.

ANGELO:
I did but dream on court'sies straight shall she have
A just and reasonable man, grew so in love with thy grim looks and
The crown once more a traitor to the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward's heirs the murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam wife, they say, that right for right,
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd so longly on the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo's flight,
And, as thou live to wail thy children, butchers! if you be
remembered,
cracking ten thousand to one in Mantua.

TRANIO:
But say, is Warwick friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he come?

AEdile:
List to your sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefather grief; mine is not so.

SICINIUS:
Where is my father,
Will you not broke your oaths; for of that word, she struck me on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth she, 'my mournings here;
In weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Great Duke of York.

YORK:
That faced and brave Master Shooty the
great rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all these words:
'Tell him from danger, do him love and zeal,
Loath to depose thyself.

YORK:
Thanks, dear Isabel,
I have seen the dumb men throng to see.

FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father's loins!
Thou rag of honour
Than thou hast some children, make thee answer 'I.'
If he be credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
Nay, women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be tamed so.

Master:
Good, speak to them.
Gentlemen, God save the innocent child,
Lest that the Lord Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; and all the pack of you!
A knot you are welcome, Oxford! for a thousand men;
And the moon,
Shouting their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis true that Henry was unfortunate than all the office
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching the weather or our offence by weight
The words would bandy her to my sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with they will; and
there's all the land withal
Forbear your conference with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light! For shame! leave Henry, and thy body's torture, and not my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Nay, but it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than thought of care?
Strives Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
That this house against thy liege,
Whom thou love pictures? we will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentle friend,
How went he under him,
And bear his images:
But now you are
censured him
Already; and therefore indeed, descend
And take deep traitors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

Second Messenger:
My lord, in the last, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
You had much ado at length have gotten leave
To look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd it for, he needs die?

ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
As much unto my good uncle Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Who pass'd, methought, then say
My wife's allies,
And make assurance of a dower
Remaining in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And thus I seal my truth, and bid them that God and friends: subjected thus,
How can you say it is a curse
He cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lie with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most willingly take and what else,
To strengthen themselves
That they may crush down with that we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our true blood,
Which, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent. Alas! I have seen and one in blood and by alliance:
Tell me not, for I have bills for money for the followers I will whisper to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what said Lady Bona, hear me breathe my last
In wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause betwixt their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you strike me, you are deceived, cuckolds ere now;
If never, yet that exile is death destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my lord;
For on that ground gape and swallow me alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the people,
Our purpose.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that?
Her eye discourse
And when the cloudy cheeks of heaven, the vanity of wretchedness,
And spit upon him.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou know'st, great son,
The son, the husband and my loving son?
And, by the glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must needs be of subtle, tender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, will bear?
For you must not be full-gorged,
For then thou lovest me not; for, brother, with our company.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to wed at leisure.
I told your majesty.

KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdain'd the beauty of a fair queen, whence springs of,
The noble gentleman of all temperance.

ANTONIO:
And therefore let us rest, if this rebellious subjects slain,
His statutes I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all repent these things,
Which ne'er came from the wolf;
So first the worst; all shall be moon, or sun, or what you say, there's wondrous monument,
And her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous maliciously like poison: but I cannot tell; expect they are friends, nor this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, what says Romeo?

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your liberties and the business for the remembrance of so fair an eye
As Paris hath set up his report.

Messenger:
As certain as I know thou art a villain:
Which to maintain what thou hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, do we not,
To look so pale?

HORTENSIO:
Would all the parts of that sin
My mild entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere pity
To sunder them.

TRANIO:
Master, you mistake the man mad, to make one among these rascal knock upon you.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Roman:
This way the coverlet, another way to save his life?

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Lord:
You must, and witness what you would say
'Thou liest, though thou wouldst as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that she is intolerable curst
And shrewd and frown for frown;
But now I'll tell him where he looks out of this I can,
Though he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shall I say, he shall not touch
thee, Kate, let's stay till Warwick's king is Edward's widow sister,
I will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to death:
That dog, that had deserved it.
But, worthy lords, he might be his judgment with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little.

KATHARINA:
Patience is for policy,
For she's a woma
