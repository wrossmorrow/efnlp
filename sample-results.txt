Having the fearful'st time to chide.

Nurse:
Mistress, how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you have lately told us;
The Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have spent our harvest of his coffers shall be joyful of thy company.

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
What, household Kates.
Here comes a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows, thy share thereof makes Clifford and the fearful head is off?

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for every word I speak,
Ye see, I drink to thee.

JULIET:
Who is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be men. Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERVING-MEN:
Here, here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, he may live:
I saw his heart:
What valour is the chase, it seems, that carries a brave fellow to't?

PAULINA:
A most unworthy all the policy, strength indeed
Thou art not honest, or,
If thou dost, and that: if all the rest march on with me.

TYBALT:
Mercutio, peace!
The man is noble ancestors achieved and city ours, he never would have his worth
As I can say nay to thee again.
And yet I bear a burthen to me,
As signal that thou art deceived:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be revenged on him that were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I will not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover about me with health and happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; thou dost here usurp
The name of king? o' God's name; once more I shall stifle in your love,
And I'll renew me in his life;
Yet none of your
voices that I for the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
What, you will accompany me thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I pray, since we have forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not this young man
More fit to bid her welcome,
And so your
flesh and blood has not only die the death.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, I had thought, by your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
All places that the king to speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices: now you have spoken a thousand men;
And the new deputy now for the rich men only: with these wounds!
Lo, in these looks I made.
But your king's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We follow'd it,
Or it hath done me wrong,
And therefore he that can yield.

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward comes!

CLIFFORD:
My gracious lord, begin that place, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter him in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet their life to
see him a man; and thou shalt still remain uncertain;
For, by your leave, she will wear in me,
As I can say nay to thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Is she your court, how I was cozened by the charm of looks,
But love the woman's means?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within this hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and we'll debate
By what safe means that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, then;
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure?
Our scouts have found you out there: you have power to do the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius,
Thy tears are my sweet prepare thee hence with Warwick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall split thy heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart
Too great for what conspire my death:
What further woe conspires against thy majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
And, for my brother Clarence' daughter: but lest you be
cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll knock once more strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him, and undertake to woo curst Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
I must be answered.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling days,
How many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to
a puppet of her.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, I will lie with thee; and thou, when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There he must not build in his
house-eaves, because musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO:
Her father keeps from all attainder of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope,
My absence for a feather will grant precious by their witchcraft, and that not only take them thus: 'I thank your grace,
For choosing for your brother:
Were he my brother's love, the tidings of our convent, and his heart.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens.

First Citizen:
How not your father make her do,
I am content to give him joy,
and make high majesty look like itself,
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the instant of the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would. Fare you well.

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did spit his body
To painful labour both by sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning roses newly wash'd with that bauble, throw it down for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we hear fearful lad
With tears and ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath set up his rest,
That you shall entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, sir, to undertake the time,
But hearts for the poor gentleman by your
habit, but your manifest house-keepers.
What are they, I beseech you, widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a command in't; though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And had no welcomes home. But what talk I of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and good, my lords, the Duke of Buckingham,
Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be ta'en forth,
Before the deputed sword,
The marshal and such news as
you never swear, and beseech you,
Grant me this bloody brow! O Jupiter, and I love him too:
The tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
It is your grace I shall deliver them that have by marriage? what of that?

MENENIUS:
Repent what you shall all our harts.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can count their worth;
But my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And then I loved the life that late I led--
Where are thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes their births good stars were opposite. But indeed I
can do you little beholding to you,
When he shall answer it.
I have no more than they were trained together, 'tis no land of the
dial is now upon the earth hath swallow'd all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall not.
Methinks I so should this grow?

CAMILLO:
He that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

Third Servingman:
Directitude.

First Lord:
So please you, let us go:
Let them have scope: though I report it,
That should end,
The life of a
man! Would the duke my father:
But what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious duke,
Harp not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I want it boots not to reward
What you must return and I can
speak to her and rid the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
A vengeance and revenge
Till thou strikest me
Sorely, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli, call him hither; for to cunning men
I will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
The king and prince shall make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, sweet wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he stares and looks
So wildly?

DUKE OF YORK:
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, that
it may be you have courage then! what cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, that should by this, is your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience,
Give me the glasses you have spent an hour,
And bring him down to sleep.

SICINIUS:
For that my sad look
Should grace thee in so fair an eye
As Paris hath set a blot upon my weapon, till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a marvellous little better:
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, believe not that look upon his court
Hides not his begot;
Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?

Third Citizen:
We have ever verified my friends: his answer was, the people's enemy is banished!

Roman:
Banished, sir.

Volsce:
He cannot come!
Is that an answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of love, this unbound lover,
To entertain them sprightly,
And let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's love and leaves
nothing but jollity. The gods themselves, as
we term it, his friends; you have drawn oaths from him not to be punish'd.

CAPULET:
He is a kind of face, methought,--for cogitation
Resides not in this kind to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends in Padua,
And how shall poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet her in their quailing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
Why, then we shall soon persuade.

LUCIO:
This may plant courage? you were used
To say extremity.

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis now some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to be got.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such as you.

First Lord:
You must not die
Till George begins with some little thinks we should have all from you; Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS:
I shall desire your city; I now came from him: there is thy constant friend,
And, madam, you must be tittle-tattling before he married me to thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a son being twain.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, knock me here, rap me here,
Here sheathe thy sword,
Or manage it to part them.
He's simple and tell my lady you will have vengeance be pursued the horse; with a little fouler than it is,
I would wish
You had not
Join'd in commission,
From which awaked, the truth of your officers at arms
Be ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this old man does when the
business in the officer
Arise to let him say so himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least, although
'Twere needful bits and curbs to headstrong humour.
He that knows no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down,
And pay you for your motion.
Son Edward, thy supposed kings encamp them still
In man as well acquaint our duteous citizens
Cast by their ebb.
Hence with heaven,
For it is done, my sovereign, of my servant to
use his master.

Third Citizen:
To lose itself turns vice, being not like this news hold of good King Edward's well-meant honest love,
But not my shame.
And I resign to thee.

LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve your highness
To take is not this suit of mine, which long I have found you out there: you have seen.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt, right royal majesty,
To have her match'd, the great comfortable friar! where is my purse to cure that blow of thine eyes. My sometimes nature will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
There have money, or
any thing against the wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir.

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news?

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear her,
As one unworthy and unnatural sleep:
A greater gift than that, if more were needful.
Look, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:
A gentler scion to the fire;
For thou hast one son; for his purpose surfeiting, he sends you this woman?

ANGELO:
Hark, how they kill me with thee to help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think it should not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all the number of the king?
Tell him, myself, the mayor then and how much
he hath eaten: they are by to hear
My sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you this night's watching.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those--Sit down, Kate, and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I show justice;
For then, I hope, thou wilt be avenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou of Juliet,
Thy beauty scratch'd with all.

SICINIUS:
Come, leave your tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, for your company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
I never wish'd to hold my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received eight thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have done to her once.

ELBOW:
Nay, if thou couldst, thou couldst, thou couldst, let him approach singing.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Now my dear lord Edward!

Children:
What stay had we but Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an ass whose back with you; he hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling at the noontide prick.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you collected them by the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior, as the case now stands, it is a copy out of mine. Come, you are welcome with words as near as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's for my father's sake so loves the prince come hither:
But what mystery there shouldst entertainment,
and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Have you not proclaim a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived, your honour!

BRUTUS:
Why?

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

BRUTUS:
Say, you chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your enemy, ever spake against the triumph die, like fire and cracks
Of sulphurous bolt
Split'st thine oracle!
I'll reconcile your friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, I prithee,
Remembering how I may do this, and he was ever respected
with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not be distinguish form: so your sweet music is,
When time is broke and Stafford, you in our behalfs; and if I speak:
That Angelo's a murderer, that I slide
O'er sixteen years you have vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the duke.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, my dread mistress that is cheap in beauty, only poor,
That when they do bend their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justice of our country's love
Though we had
Our wish, which side
They have placed there;
And, sweet sprites, they fought together
He throws without blows! Despising,
For you, the warrant
That virtuous maid
Subdues me quite, makes my number more.
At my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair
That have been a mouse-hunt in your minds, if you take with the measure of his eyes.
This precious jewel of my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
He hath deserves death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to bid his brother: soon at night
I'll tell money; he
utters them.

ROMEO:
What hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother Montague, in Buckingham, back'd with post-horse up to heaven,
Since you will not fail: 'tis twenty years; and then implore her, in my voice, that our kingdoms, my poor house look to behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET:
A jealous hood!
Now, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Citizen:
Before we proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake my person, noble father laid on thee,
For those defects I have been out, I warrant your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius Coriolanus in Corioli and his customary gown.

Fourth Citizens:
To the rock with his deep sighs;
But all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes are witness of her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with patience,
I may not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
And I'll believe your graces both
A happy and a joyful bride.
I wonder how our princely daughter had a thousand men;
And these elements,
If e'er again I meet him in the chair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my stalls,
And all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
How often have I told you of:
I pray you,
Stand to me in name of fault, I must not, I need not add more fuel to your foe,
A villain that is her burying grave that is giddy thinks that yet hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight, and therefore for assurance
That my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but thou'rt too much: brings a'
victory in his breast forges, that his soul! Fly, lords, away.
To fight against her maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the death.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much grace to pardon me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Bound to himself so secret and so close,
So far from hence to France, hoping the career
Of laughing with a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful of your womb,
To quicken you;
The mathematics and the language I have learned it without circumstance, to curse thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in the tortured soul;
There lies the game.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once!
To prison with him; but either
Had borne the action. We have made him to resign his crown and comfort
Starr'd most unluckily,
That we may arm us to encounters,
though not in life.
I'll tell him where I stay: give the people! Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
You so remain.

MENENIUS:
I'll undertake the devil tempt thee to the wars of York fetch down the treasures seized, our soldier, statesman and a swearing both
They prosper best of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had thought, by your leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too little for your
executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not mock us.

Second Servingman:
Whence are you?

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, and hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, no more of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
My lord, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd thee with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only like a guest.

First Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter, surely:
comes there any more of it?

Page:
My husband lives, the true man's
apparel fits your thief, your true king's queen.
And you shall not house within the earth,
That living mortals, hearing of
this business.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita!
But O, the noble Duke of Hereford, Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were I
A man, the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind of Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art not fish; if thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Would I might
But ever see that man!

PROSPERO:
Before the gates. Why, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd feast,
Whereto thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be thus!
How often have I told you, I, he was a man; this, in respect, my gracious lord; I'll to my wedding bed.

Nurse:
Out upon you! Tell me, good my lord.

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

MENENIUS:
If it be ne'er so mean,
But 'banished'? Hang up philosophy,
And while it is some meteor that thou wouldst,
There shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the six years,
And nothing else
But fair posterity,
Even to the fight.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Such it seems,
Of this fair proportion me in every part,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle orator,
Inferring arguments;
And, if you would never endure sweet beauty's pen;
Examine every married with her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Unless you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit to resist both wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is a kinsman to the name of Henry with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Soldier:
See, they have
had inkling this fortnight what we do not see
We tread upon, and never of me aught
But what likelihood of breach,
Which well appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday is to-morrow.

LEONTES:
You will be gone.
Look to your worship in that gracious lord:
I am a subject.

LEONTES:
To your worship for it. What is the matter?

Messenger:
You are welcome: what's your will, because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometimes you would lay on me,
The right and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our army hear me.

Clown:
You have often heard my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
Which, as thou hast breath
To say to me that all the
instrument.
Go thou, and fill another room
And triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by heaven to dream upon the cheek,
But not my griefs; still am I king;
Then am I king of the barren earth
Which serves you;
No profit grows where is my wife.

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art death's fool;
For him thou lay'st,
Think not the king all, every word deserves
To have the field, and for a hand, and
called me brother; and, I think,
For men so old as we to keep your name Menenius?

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
In vain though apt affection,
which cannot choose but hate thee,
Pronounce a sentence my own life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
If so, then be not too much lenity?
Bootless is flight, make for Sicilia,
And therefore look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is some sap in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
These violent ends
And in this world frowns, and Edward's throne.

BISHOP OF YORK:
I will be his conduct to convey me to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
Fear not, my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
And she was wean'd,--I never shall I complain myself?

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them to light: would he had'! 'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
Sir, we have need of me,
And much effuse of blood out of the table and shall.

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the other side, I cheque'd my friends, most charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, I think, is thirty.

CAPULET:
Marry, this Claudio is condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the best is, he lives not
In these conflicts
What may be sworn they are at it!

LARTIUS:
O general,
Caius Marcius poor in, that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only take them thus: 'I thank you both. What course I mean to make a monster, a
very monster in apparel,
In gait and countenance, sir.
Signior Petruchio, will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista's keep my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Shall be well.

BALTHASAR:
I dare no longer stay:
These words:
'Tell him,' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with the buttock of the wood:
I, measuring his affection not gone forth, I'll make thee safe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have it,
And soundly too: your house:
And in that quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it blows,
Commanded always by the grace,
Voice, gait and action of a man!

MENENIUS:
Why, noble lord?

YORK:
It may be I will go root away
The benefit thereof makes them wear their 'larum, and the rest,
And if you can behold it,
I'll make you
The queen is spotless reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of the duke: you
shall use me hereafter say unto you, what he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him our own voices with our beads?
Or shall I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, faint-hearted and deformed lump,
Not like a Christian cross
Against the Greeks that would beseem the Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although my head i' the sun
And with full as many lies in his
behalf as you have vow'd revenge, dear God, with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
No quarrel, and the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
Why whisper you, sweet dear, prove mistress: here's my wife?

Page:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua; I'll find Romeo
To comfort me:
Nurse! What should not become mockers, if they shall feel the loss, but not the devils are here
writ, and can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares you give thanks, the exchequer of the wind:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier, an't like your honour, I am the son of Clarence hath a thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not thy son:
Sweet York, be patient till the heavens, envying earth's glory.

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a coil! come, what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring you gave in charge,
Is now dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation,
If he had been by, to have helped the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his king.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, know you that banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come!
Who knocks so hard? whence comes the wantons with outstretch'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave
And come again, transformations
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray you, your name, I think, you'll find good cause to fear.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
Shake it off again?

Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest, though loath, yet must I be content:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too cold in thinking on the frowning judge? or who pronounce this same thought o'er-run her love?'
And then to have her houses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio.
God save you, sir, he comes to me in name of fault, I must needs abide;
It boots thee not, proud queen, to make her bear the burden soon at night
I'll send some packing that our general.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
So, let the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
We shall be absent. Wend you with a man by his own affection gapes to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I should confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace the air,
Or dedicate his beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
We must not build in his
house-eaves, because Lucentio's father is not all unknown to the duke:
Post thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the wars
Like a great kindred;
it is well allied: but it is a
power that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a feeling loss.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissemble with my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
What's here, and to save the innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art always figuring diseases under his devouring death do what he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Derby.
To your goodness of you common men could beat forty of them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou, thou little harm; you'll forswear themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The ground of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
Indeed, you shall have met again
And are upon you as you are. When
you speak doth lack some gentlemen, prepare you, lords, for us to do
But to command
And do my spirit!
But was not taken yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
And would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy steps no more
Than they whom youth and cause, I would say
'Thou liest: Queen Margaret was a prophet's eye
Seen how his son's son should be denied;
We pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking oceans dry:
Where one on his side fights, thousands moe
That go before to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be my company.

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his foreign passages, and in that sense thou wilt, for I have heard of him;
A merchant of great Bolingbroke
Hath seized the gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossips in this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he shall be to strew his lady's grave;
And bid him come and married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, sit fast; I mean, my child,
And this shall be so; let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman,
To whom the Kentishmen will willingly humbles himself more proud birds,
Have wrought thee to insult?
It needs not, nor I greatly care not:
It is a kind of medicine of our house!
If any spark of honour, trust it,
He shall her sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st sweet music is,
When time is broke and Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contents
Shall witness to
The times that spurs too fast growing sprays,
That look into me with so sour a face.

Nurse:

JULIET:
Feeling so the head, and on that side yours.
Now is the supreme King of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father be very rich: but thou usest to forswear it;
they would swear down each part of your story put
Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.

HASTINGS:
But I shall be done, sir, none.

CAMILLO:
I very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I say, such a man.
But now I see our lances arbitrate
The swelling wrong-incensed peers.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much for my poor services, took from you
The apprehension of his property,
Turns to the ground,
I have tumbled past the marsh
After the battle came he; where he hath woo'd.
Now must I to the morn;
Your friends the thorns and is rent with that
Which thou shalt command, but not prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very pink of courtezans,
But meditating with his rapier's point
Than can the substance of divinest show!
Just opposite with heaven?
That Henry means to wed at leisure.
I told you before, and I will for tidings of my death.

Second Musician:
What a pestilent knave is this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
O God, I have seen thee stem, and thou return'st no greetings that are forbid: 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, there is order ta'en forth,
Before the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain: but for this I draw in many a tear
And stop those maims
Of shame seen through the army, cheering up the watch.

PARIS:
This is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Percy, for thy speeches
Will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol.

All:
We will persuade him, be it possible
That which grieves me for my father father, behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should kill thee with old cramps,
Fill all the rest of that worthy work perform'd!

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:
Ay, my lords, he did it to
please his mother win the Duke of Hereford, Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
What, would your highness
Will take again your queen, and young
Drop-heir that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter than my guiltiness such as you.

First Lady:
Why, my young son of York
Hath power to the enemy
Is all unknown;
And were I any thing.

KING RICHARD III:
The advancement and my friends an oath.
I know by that he's dead!

CAPULET:
Talk not, Signior Baptista Minola,
Renown'd in Padua.
Do you hear a play
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown your exclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my books, he furnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument no longer staying but to give the fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lop away, that bears the type of King of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer made the air unwholesome counsel to be heard,
Where will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life.
As for the hire
Of their own rates; whereof, one in this fardel and I know he loves me, and I direct you how
you shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when the head, and set it on you to assist him, it shall become of Bushy? where is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that he did believe no other lectures to her:
You understand thee well; and might well
Be taken from the usurped throne.
The love I bear thy glories makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceed: this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it: and when with grievous sins,
That you shall be so.
Enrich the time to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo's man;
With what thou and none of mine.

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY:
Sir, if it please myself:
A cold premeditation for my brother,
Or with an outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the son?

RICHARD:
Brother, farewell.

GEORGE:
Where's Richard Duke of Gloucester think of it.
You may not prove a whip to me; my stay must be
stolen out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
If it be honest plain
men, what I speak
My body shall make one,
Though they cannot, die in their hands I have done what I promise you
You have won a happy victory to Rome.

Second Murderer:
What we will play with my father's house.
Go on, and fetch him hither.
The nobility could judge
What 'twere to be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide away this shame,
Which so roused up with wind.

Lord:
Even as the waving sedges play with reason and discourse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bride shall suffer what wit can make him a king!
Edward thy son, which thy two sweet son, as thou hast more of that.

CORIOLANUS:
O that ever
Ran on the ground.

PETER:
Then have you argued, sir; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected; else, if heaven do think there be no remedy.
Come, sir: did you so? And do you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years; a silly time
To make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
What is your cause gone too. The duke
yet would have been ere now, and what said Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in the Tower.
And, madam, go with me!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What then?

First Citizen:
You have no cause to heaven.
I'll in, to be revenged for this time,
For what I list,
Or ere I journey to your honour.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were fairer than my breast.

EDWARD:
Where is the matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
His word is more than all the book;
And, as he stoop'd my neck under your grace's pardon, and I find it,
And that which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That seem like prudent helps, are very welcome, Bolingbroke
Hath seized the gentleman
Whom I would sustain some score or two of ginger, but that
Which would be drunk too;
that let me inform yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son's sake; and he, a marble heart;
The tiger will be Romeo, whom you serve, you might well
Be taken from this slaughter him,
For I intend but only a repair i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
In that you make in the mind.

CAMILLO:
This is a creature,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and there too. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say; I charge thy sulphur with a band of thine;
Thy place is famous isle?

CATESBY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I wore it at your conference with them:'
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some meaning or moral of this from Henry's heart.

YORK:
Richard hath in field
Should not for my life, my crown;
All's true that you love.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Of the king shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,
Where nothing that appeared in them; but the bran.' What say you to it?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis there,
That our garments, and cureless are my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them in parts remote,
To fright thee. I beseech you, mark it well.
'Tis since these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants:
Besides, you know not what to take leave of you,
Which I will purchase out abuses:
Therefore, I pray thee, peace.

Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
That you might have you to your hand;
And what love can do that dares the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blow of thine.

BIANCA:
Believe me, lord, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
Now, by mine honest friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept her, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark makes sweet division prove
That every part,
Like to my fortune ever taints
The happy masks that kiss fair ladies, and the third usurp'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a threefold death not let me speak of cannot in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a model, our firm estate,
When corn was given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt anger him
To raise a spirit in his face,
And bite thy tongue and heart's oppression.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such as the daughters;
County Anselme and his brethren here, their lives bad friends were contrary, if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our great danger
Which this bloody knife
Shall play the tortures he shall this be prevented me. Here, Signior Baptista, lest you be cropp'd before him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every meaner man of Pisa; by report
I know him passing wise;
Though thou live in Richard's friends.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou not shame with thee!
These words?

HORTENSIO:
How now! which of you, if you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO:
I know you that?

Widow:
Thus I conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is not this deceit.

Boy:
Then, grandam, is our father welcome,
And show no sign of fear.

Third Servant:
O, yes, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural,
To bend their chains fetter'd the king;
And what a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us hear your motion.
Son Edward, thy supposed their state was touch'd,
They would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses him from the hollow eyes of death, all men depart.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him to prison.

CALIBAN:
As wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
Talk not of your own daughters, Richard, when thou hast broke it in the hopes of him: sanctifies himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through both
I see some sparks of better nature.

POLIXENES:
No, madam, no; I may not so extenuate his offence?
There's more behind
But such a day to-morrow hold divided councils
His honour and his wife is in Corioli, call him,
With all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
And give him my commission
To let him learn to know how this foul act;
Peace shall go hard if Cambio go without her, follows thus;
Thou shalt continue and laugh upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
You shall help to put him i' the ground,
And future ages groan for this once my will shall I then comes in his head;
And, whilst I live;
And being bred in broils
Hast not the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Biondello.

GREMIO:
No; if without peril it be possible,
For those doves' eyes,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but four days gone
Since I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that they may work,
All exercise hath been long a sleeper; but, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think he'll be to Rome
As is the other grow
Faster than she:
Be not her maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For what, I pray thee, leave me and her allies
This is that banish what they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome. Look, signior, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity:
The crown, and, with that hand of mine.
Lord Hastings with my forefather grief; mine is not so;
For sorrow ends not when it was found. But O, the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then?

First Servingman:
I' the common muck of the night or in the morning comes too late.

LUCENTIO:
I do confess
I loved him half a score knaves or so:
why, that's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
These are the violet in the sexton's face;
Having no other way
Unless the adage must be tittle-tattling before her troth-plight to your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to him in his life to get the cause that, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, am stern, and love for love allow;
The other, when she has obtain'd your eyes almost out in the sentence of your womb,
To quicken your increaseth.

Third Servingman:
Where's Captain Margaret, Margaret, and here my life lay down and fell Mowbray fight.
My loving lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, 'tis no matter for the time be out? no more!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
See how the sea for to obey the moon
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
Let it command a mirror hither will not burden thee;
For I will ride,
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very
distant time stood, as it were so that our foe.

KING RICHARD III:
Well,
Go muster men: my counsel:
but I shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your follows Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming.

MENENIUS:
The lamb.

MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two, to
make merry withal?

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
Let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine;
It is the lady of the house is a respected with his head! Now, by Saint Paul, this news be true,
I never in thy life,
That I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then we shall be to him then as our good meaning, for our day of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
But you are old enough and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved friend,
This hand hath made me four and twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject speaks,
Stirr'd up remorse:
But if thou mean shall be so; he shall have this crack to be in my dread lord, and safe in Leicestershire:
These high wild hills and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
There is a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I do not think it should seem,
Hath sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth to know.

BRUTUS:
God-den to you all:
And in the power of the present comfort from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and that quickly buzzed into his mercy,
And leave your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your hearts,
That noble honour'd life
With ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be my recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know it please you, let it strike.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember me what a face I have,
Though full of tears, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well have your
action of battery on thee.
Heaven doth with holy words,
Their coursers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio's son,
A man well know
The royal fool thou copest with dreams;--how can this be?--
With what he would forget it: 'Wilt thou behold this presence makes us unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I saw my country:
He that has the benefit of seniory,
And let me die, to look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am his.

YORK:
Why, madam, have comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To help Cominius.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's time enough to be his paramour?
For fear of that, that know the sound of Marcius, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city.

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction, ruin and decay:
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
The second hour in the acting it.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling pirates, that she will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you have beheld me give away my crown, and with a little money for these great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards ourselves;
For now we sit to chat as well as by nature's course,
Some of those triumphs in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond with thy love, as school-master.

VALERIA:
Come, lay aside life-harming heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou mayst slide
from my shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With good old folks,
how the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his natural king?

WARWICK:
And I'll be sworn by, both divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported?

GRUMIO:
And then, as we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our company:
Come, I have wept for thine.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
Away with me to make his requests by
particular saint,
Were testimony, or I'll seize thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign and himself,
On pain to be found false and treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is the duke a clout
Steep'd in their own points on their souls by turning them from us,
And we their hands,
To kill the other fling it at thy father's brother with thy lips such scorn, for they cannot abide to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you think to dine with me to meet him at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Well, my lord. Were he not Romeo, that did ever fence the rest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is thy crown.
What mutter you, or what you say.

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in your reproof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither,
As is the spring that I must wed
Ere he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this seven years;
For they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these lands are to be sent to the Tower:
My Lady Grey!
And now, instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom stands on brittle glory shineth in this resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The kingly-crowned head, their
true descent;
And there repose you for the drabs and
the knaves, you shall not make you and he are near in love.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn them to his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, before the deputy sent my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will not pity;
For at their beads, 'tis hard to climb,
And the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience take thou for thy life: take up my mistress.

GRUMIO:
I confess to you.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir, God forbid his gracious lord:
I am a subject strikes
At thy greatest dower
Shall have you ever to our special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger,--

LUCIO:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem to affect speech and fearful were they all have such vantage of the fearful king,
And not neglected; else, if you strike again.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horse stumbled, how she prayed,
that never felt a wound.
But, soft! company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

FRIAR JOHN:
I could myself
Take up a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrate;
Letters should not work
Maliciously.

First Soldier:
He's the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt anger him: 'twould anger him.

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With instruments of mighty strength,
Gives in your own, you
should not,
Bound with all the rest is held at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What seal is that, that knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Then give me leave to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a bear, the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have spent the day.
Brother, I am going? To Baptista as a schoolmaster for that.

Second Senator:
Pray you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged on men, and make high account of you;
For they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these
things should be the hearts
Of all the troubler of the king, why should not for this is he
Must help you truth and truth in virtue,
That, in the midst of the state
To one whom thou so lovest,
With all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry died, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these elements
Of fire and waters 'twixt your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitably with me have you break the story we late talk'd of,
To part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo's hand did set it down. Is ink and paper,
And hire post-horse up to heaven I had your father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, sir, now
I am for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
I talk of dreams,
Which after hours give leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant and give my scene such growing
As you had slept;
And we, in pity of the two kings called my
father; for the nobles they are, here are writ.
Sirrah, go see what I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, my lord. Were he not Romeo, take my ring.

Servant:
Is dead.

LORD ROSS:
No good at all,
Did not offended him.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business,
You would entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Thus strange, but yet my inward soul
With nothing to me.

GONZALO:
And were his very words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem to dive into their eyes,
Yet, in protection
And favour as the rest?

DORSET:
Be of good cheer. Pray you once more I shall incur to pass it,
Having fully dined before.

KING HENRY VI:
But didst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all of us, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO:
Enough, with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal bowels of the deep?

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I come in partial. Sir, he must not. I wish
you much mirth.

Shepherd:
What, art thou as young as I, Juliet thy love prove likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam,
I must be gentle, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your grace hath not used it before them.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will walk myself
To this most precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every good
whore!' Why, is not the cause of my imprisonment. What's your own.
For this time.
What, is there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
But of all, we were afoot.

Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the lady: O, so light of heart
Look'd wondering: what of him?

POLIXENES:
Wherefore was I born to this, that, at so slender warning,
You are sent for to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some other chase;
For I myself have done this?
Ere he would waken him.

First Senator:
Howsoever you have, but of what he would have none ill, sir; error i' the bill.
I commanded the sleeve-hand and take him for the greatest part of philosophy,
To comfort to your grace to pardon me; I may not linger thus? I cannot brook it.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what of these?
Why, is not the dash of my fortune of the court?

Third Gentleman:
But few,
And those whom you call him noble that was;
But that you have
As little joy, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Tell him, myself, the mayor then and till the heavens!
Why does the worser is predominant; and 'tis much pride
For fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory of your condition stands for the table and almost shoulder'd in their eyes, and his sister,
Finding your father?
The readiest way to get.
Uncle, give me! O, tell not me:
I knew she were!
She speaks not true:
Some twenty thousands moe
That go before it pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, devise excuses for thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou name,
That cropp'd the passage where the
dull tribunes, hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here was hack'd to death your numbness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as that which I possess;
But what a foolish woman:
The main blaze of riot cannot live, I hope; and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland as touching hers, make blessed sun:
But sun it is not. Was this fault?
If on the first choice. Follow me, and I'll find out logs,
And never should cut off my head
As is a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Who wrought it with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward to my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my weapon, we are beset with the fusty plebeians would the scandal to the Volsces are in the veins o' the monster's, wants nothing doubt
prevailing and these detestable things not so held,
Communicatest with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, Jule?' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
He hath a garden circummured within this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
O heavy times, begetting wonder as
You, gracious lord, I tender your person most, that he will give me occasion to use me at his pleasure,
If presently repair to us.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpets boldly and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make her come. What, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I see, changing woman!
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes this change?

MENENIUS:
For them! I cannot do it; yet I'll make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your great action: therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I love thee well; and hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome you are:
Things past redress are now as fresh as when we saw our sunshine brew'd a shower of courtesy,
This will I come
And lead thy daughter's joints?
And pluck thee by the ear for that time?

First Senator:
The people in the world nor your manhood that durst make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never hear him.

SICINIUS:
What then remains
That you might well
Be taken from their sights; I'll bear
Take hence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him from foul despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these woes were all forth. Well, I will be dangerous to me: to Aufidius lies: is he in his bed
Have I enjoy'd,
I never injured thee? when done thee still stand between loathness and obedience, and thy
petitionary countrymen, my loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a book, his face that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once perform'd, let all the town
Here in my house affords.

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee here alone.
What is your cause to hold my peace until
You have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not moved him as in honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, I'll have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot on her wedding cheer;
But so it is, it is no boot,
And place your hand too much
The rashness of a woman's head.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me the more, being what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honour therein,
And lay the summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous daughter,
And mean to make a puppet of her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told you, my lords. I wot your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it was for his fathers and her uncle?
Or, he that sent us hither now to slaughter,
In your condition they account I well may, give,
And in that quarrel was, and I am your wife, this lady, and myself,
With all prerogative
Calls not your father's fault art thus exposed
To loss and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cost.
But first I'll do my errand. The good gods forbid
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall be to him then as our good will were subjects now,
Whose state and widow you withal,
To buy you a better nature.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you, sir, let him be crown'd; in him your comfort have we twain forgot!
Pray you, poor gentleman that haply knows more.
The news, Rogero?

Second Watchman:
Hold him in our arms.
Cousin of Buckingham and I
Are come to join with black despair an enemy's grave.
Hark! the kings
and the proudest of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to know
If yet her brother Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently the people--which time shall not stand by
too, and suffer it,
A brand to the heart
Than when I parted hence, but have you no countermand,
That I may minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, the enemy?

Messenger:
And thou didst love York, and yet I would he had continue
in it five weeks without distinctly,
Then meet and jump in one.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens and friends
Have shaken Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt
Till it was which caused
Our swifter composition,
And hold you as a thing to any, if
I be not that honourable villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! while I pause, serve in your life
And that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
I do beseech your majesty,
Wert thou environ'd with a bloody supper in.
Where is my bond of life, dear God, with our cousin, you debase your princely knee
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO:
Long live King Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have,
To be full quit of those love had spoke,
Even since it serves my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon my weapon, till the tears that she will still lives and thine
Were not the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little.

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Your husband.
O Isabel, will you go
To give your cause gone too. The duke's in us; and we will both together in my sleep
To undertakes
Is numbering clock:
My thoughts.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge, Brakenbury, and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder what title in your outward actions shows itself
Against the senate, who,
Under the colour of his usual game,
He shall not rule her?

PAULINA:
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
Should a like language and thou return'st no greetings to the Tower,
On pure heart's love,
Tendering my person:
Tell them how Edward put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the hand that slew her brother; and, I think, if you had the strength
As to take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings, yet they must perforce.

YORK:
While we pursued further than this deed does require! And blessing
Against the form and model of thy home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty to our presence?

FLORIZEL:
See, your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance surely like a fawning greyhound,
Which runs himself, his queen and my servant Catesby
Where nothing like death to any he that utters them as he had eaten ballads and all are Bolingbroke.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are looked for:
I am your good worship for your brother's life.
Wrath makes no conquest to my soul,
For Edward is at hand;
When the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock it in the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil tempt thee to be but young and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
How do you all and me amongst the rest appeal,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make my very heart,
I think your father wipe his eyes,
And that same villain, ere thy hand,
In sign of what thou shalt hear; 'tis in three parts
melted away with heart and soul and all be as it is an open room and good words to little purpose. Therefore, Lord Oxford, that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this foul act;
Peace shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, Lancaster, and what is there any more than your lordship came to seek that name which is a truth;
And what thou wert king; who, travelling towards him.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak and tell what he did spend and spent not that;
I speak from certainties himself,
As well as Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with the grossness of the queen hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptists, to your royal sword your banish'd from his native right?
And am I last that knows you not.

MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has the benefit of seniory,
And let go by the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd
Desires access to you.
How now, good my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle night, come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine image!
Sirs, I will marry straight
Adonis painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, good friends;
And, as I further scope
Than for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good my lord; it is more pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with like relation of my right.

WARWICK:
This is a strange picklock, which touch'd
To the nobles.

SICINIUS:
Therefore, in mine opinion: that King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she deny, Lord Hastings; I will hence for France:
Think I am dead.

SOMERSET:
It is now apparent?

Provost:
I shall be the neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, to keep and kill thy heart.

Clown:
If it be husbanded with modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the hedge-corner, in the high'st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the great Lord of Northumberlands; two brave bears, Warwick, Warwick! Montague!
See, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue,
That in a Christian service and true obedience, and the king's grown bankrupt, break at once!
To prison walls,
And, for more slander too.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest.
Three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Well, my dread mistress.

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's go:
I am the sister of
Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark me;
To be received;' and each in either's powerful at it.

MENENIUS:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joy have I infringed my vow.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is most obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion,
When what's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should ensue.

MIRANDA:
What is that calls

LUCIO:
How now! which of you the service for so good a grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessing.

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any of the house within thy help and holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny her aiding hand therein negligent, foolish boy, the king here the kindred of the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which, how far off lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles you do keep from me
The rest will serve
For sweet discourses; I will never more remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Help, ye citizens are up, and Tybalts. Tybalt's death,
And I in all despite;
Give him death by inches.

SICINIUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheels of
Caesar? art thou happy:
A pack of blessings for curses never pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times to come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Good morrow, Kate; for that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

ISABELLA:
And have prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still forget,
Forgetting any other.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I shall. My women, come; you must call him
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made you for this hint,
When we shall have; besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence to some alive,
Where I shall kneel till to the bones
Of all my buried ancestors achieved with blood:
But you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great loss,
That with you.
Catesby hath sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not to deny 't. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Then show it most of their heads shall proceeding:
Yet, for a greater soldier than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS:
Which they did budge
From rascals worse than I, are ignorant, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his present?
Must all determined to prove a villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
I'll tell tales.

QUEEN:
It may be so, for it is now to repossess the crown,
For many lives stand but as at first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I was no gentleman, I'll prove upon that.
Our praises are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of these my borrow'd likeness, I do well believe that, since the nuptial finish'd,
Let him not speak, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
Neither, my lord?

KING RICHARD III:
My father of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the place:
This proveth Edward's greatest dower
Shall have no telling.

PETRUCHIO:
When you disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the people's voices,
Allow their cobbled shoes. They say the truth of your own turn, you shall be much in your former; but she will be here.
This is the duke with thee: so often hast bestrid,
That horse that think you, if he wear your love and quite lost their hearts :
God keep all this.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou know'st it well,
Thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA:
O, that it may enter butcher Mowbray's waxen coat,
And never look'd for no reply.
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And I am ready to come again, transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great liberty
Here's a gentleman:
'Thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo bear the golden window of the land
Have we more sons? or are we like to Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! Spake you not broke your oaths?

First Lord:
For her, my lord.

WARWICK:
Richard not far from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick be so near to Hermione hath done
To thee particular,
Crowns what you rather wishing a more strike all that I can do for him;
Unless you please, since you come to pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we could hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off;
I would you not do much to my good lord; and with my thwartings of your sorrow was too strict to make the man mad, to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue-tied sorrows leave to go to shrift this afternoon;
And these same instant army we can make her speak as my understand from me her mind.

KING HENRY VI:
But did you never may.

POLIXENES:
Prithee, peace.

SICINIUS:
Tell not me:
I knew she would continue this united league:
I every day's news. I
pray you, do.
I'll know his purpose so barr'd,
it follows there, they in her head, though it seems
As may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous to our human actions, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that you command, I'll rack thee with much more contempt, speeds from me that he hath
By his attorneys are denied me;
And yet she is inferior veins
From me receive we from our morning's eye,
'Tis but thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
If to have done with words, my lord, I'll tell him of you.

FROTH:
I thank your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well get you home,
And yet my letter back. Then all afire with me to clothe you as become a prison:
Ah, would they else be contented: sometime loved! I take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not believe
The envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would die,
Until your lord's departure, as you know, I not acquainted with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the fashion and the third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD II:
Then call thee something thou wilt stay with me?

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this stick
And make conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
It is the quarrel is between us;
Of you, my noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I will; and
therefore delay not, give thy hand;
And see you read no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA:
The image of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.

Servant:
My master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray you,
In wholesome beverage,
Account me not your services
Past and to come, in wooing sorrow leave awhile,
We must talk in secret holds, both Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were kneel'd to and importune me no farther than they are in a most warlike preparation.
if my brother made
Had not been commanded to deliver us!

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
O, sir, you know, 'tis far gone,
When evil deeds,
I would say, sir. I know thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall
feel, will break,
And rather proved the subjects unto me:
And tells us, what occasion,
As index to the state so? No, no, good Kate, I will counterfeit
fairly last night.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent witchcraft, and that instructed.

ANGELO:
The law hath not money for the county take you assure her?

GREMIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, good my lord, be good to us! Come, masters, each man take his stand:
The king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and medicine of our order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore be resolute.

Second Murderer:
What shall I lead the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord, my mother says, if I may be consul, I have not deserved children live, whose puissance on either side
Give the all-hail to thee shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!

RICHMOND:
Good night our parting,
'Be serviceable to my soul: here
Clarence comes along with me:
Uncle, my brother Clarence, to myself,
Because that I can urge against self: O, preposterous estate as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Methought I think thou canst not teach me how
To name the disease, and shall be done, pack up: down with that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious, than they are used to bear him company:
Come, I have bethought me of your adversity,
For wise men ne'er spend the time o'erpast;
For I have Pisa left
And am to Padua; there to end
Where he abides.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my service, when
Some certain words he spake,
'Have I no friendly vow,
That I may name it?
No, no, men living flatter those things,
And say 'Will't please the king King Edward hath in field
Should not be a charity in sin
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
I did not well served in noble breasts.
What shall go to prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And in this woolvish toge should I think?
Heaven shield my mother stands;
For, well I wot.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford?
Is not Gaunt just, and true obedience; agree with our chiefest virtue, and
She said thou wast
not there for welcome but my body's action teach my mind
A most intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of love?
Who told me, in these enfoldings?
hath not money for thee;
For I will have Katharina the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest touches of all advice
My strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night yield both my life,
I'ld throw it down for yourself and all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fair daughter; and there pieced with packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were to incense the boar before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am for you are i' the fardel?
Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself
Find in myself to see thee, noble consul!

Citizens:
The gods preserve thee! welcome, Somerset, with Oxford fled with the nobles;
And you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem you from thy virtues spoke of him.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I would I cannot temperately; your promise for the selfsame words to thee belongs,
Myself disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the fire, shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.
I have not deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, is he not thine own and leave thine own good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortune,
As 'twere my daughter of Agenor had,
That made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you fear?
'Tis nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, are not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him home from banishment
On yon proud man, should take her hence to Friar Penker; bid them bring them away.

ANGELO:
Well; come to meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that alacrity of spirit.
While you are too shrewd.

ARCHBISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow next
We will for tidings of her death:
And here's to right.
Well, Juliet, if the measure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
I do defy him, and showed him a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such remedy as, to save my life:
You understanding; and, for her sister's shame? What should I knock? is there a maid westward rooteth from the bishop here, at whose hands
Which made the coward
Turn terror in his love was an eternal life.
The most replenish'd villain Tranio,
That face of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which didst unworthy and unnatural,
Provokes this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon you for him: let him call the peace of the war
Destroy what lies before him;
'Twas very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that day.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mistake me much;
I do lament,
And interjoin their ireful hands,
Are at our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they cannot at ease on the earth's cold face;
But chiefly to take the priest that spake to me:
I am my father father:
The which no balm can cure their hands,
You adopt your policy, how is it?

Clown:
Is there not milking-time, when you cast out, like to autumn's corn,
Have we march
Upon the stroke of death.
Here's goodly work!

Second Servant:
Dost thou feel the spur;
Whether to depart, I am come to take his natural rest
Till Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
My lords, and here I take thee?

KATHARINA:
A witty mother! why, she was dead ere thou fly the realm of this plain.
Let's march without peril it be possible things put upon't!

LEONTES:
Where's Caius Marcius, Numa's daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse:
See where stand his guard.
Courage, man; the hurt cannot forget
That we are too dear: the leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for him
Shall fly out of many mouths--
How probable I do not jest with saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous unsafe lunes i' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this make no conclusion
I now begin with her.
Pray you, be gone.
Mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had been silent. Please you dismiss me either with the thorns we stand in arms,
To prove it on thee by my lord, and leave am arm'd
With his unkindness at my hands;
Who now the price of his chin and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when thou hast never in my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a heavy heart.
Come, cousin, seize the crown imperial; lilies of all and that which
angled for mine eyes:
Sleeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no less
Than misery itself would give't thee, from the earth or ere
It should be else?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes my number more.
At my poor heart for anger burns; I cannot love,
I am too old to fawn upon 'em,
For the instalment of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are they dead?

Gardener:
Depress'd he is already sick and like a fearful man
He should rend that be heir to the crown,
And, whilst I live;
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves?
So when this arm of mine.
Now prisoner the very cipher of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater a run
but my head and my name
Be yoked with his shaft
To soar with him rises weeping: these are almost here. How many stand
for consul, which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think 'twas in another such.

FLORIZEL:
No, good madam, bear it all.

Messenger:
The Duke of Gloucester?
Now, for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can count their worth;
But my true love's passion, silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO:
I have so; because thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be that small, God, I beseech you, folly, or mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible he should
Be free as is the east,
When he stands--
That ever Katharina,
And thou a kingdom and
Destroy'd his country;
And what you are weary of the poor;
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest as the dove;
She is not hot enough the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And had no welcomes home. But what thou hast proved so unnatural: desire not
To get slips of this is the prince's near ally,
My very friend, for joy of his fortune,
And to 't they go like lightning in the execution. If you think.

CLARENCE:
A little mouse, every unworthy and unnatural: desire not
To get slips of them.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
I thank you for your voice: I
met you at the farthest off you
could have toss'd me on the party tried
The daughter
Call'd Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not love so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and York; then haply she will recover:
I have sat here all the English king.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance.
Be plain, good soul,
To counsel may the cause of my son's exile hath more cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial finish'd,
Let him that got it, sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO:
Assay the power of the king's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD III:
There let him go while the traitor lives, the true ground of your young prince what I am, but stopp'd
And left thee but a very pretty one.

MOPSA:
I have lived to kill a wife with kind embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of my heart;
With mine own confession to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters of Antigonus,
I charge you, as you hope the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this life
Lie hid moe thousand times more joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this token: rise, and let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Brother, farewell.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of all this will not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my noble lords
And hearten those that feeds their fury:
The sands are number'd that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much fills their heads.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin; farewell,
'lady, lady.'

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful day, O woful day!

PARIS:
Give me some ink and paper,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she dares trust me with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the rest,
Out of hope--
Mistake me much;
I do lament thy miserable age!
What stratagems
Upon so soft a subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blood in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, farewell.
Relenting fool, and a coward,
Which heavy sorrow makes thee abominable and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master? yes, marry, sir, with the county stays.

Nurse:
You say well and look on.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot with such friends as we
Few words suffice; and the painter with me for any thing
That none shall have them, if I once know where.
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your most gracious lord, I'll give no blemish to her honour true than your suspicion:
Beseech you, sir, what are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little souls of all that offer service than to marry but by my entertainment,
I do present yourself, or else
To him had left me to a bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Alas, I am the mother of the poor world's peace!
Thou wast provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'tis bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO:
But are they that were mortal poison, rather
Than carry it myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleep when such a desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and good Paulina,
Who hast the one deserve so ill as you, and mine,
So your dislike, to whom I will importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of the king;
And what to leave, ha?

GREMIO:
What! this gentleman,
Whom I unnatural,
Provokes this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon him.
At a few drops of tears:
Come home to ye!--you must rise and be happy rivals in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, I am going with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a puissant power:
Even now we heard thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of it.

First Murderer:
Not to kill him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king enacts more wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
For both hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this night's watching.

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, you are not,
Let them want nothing slow to slack his haste good hope; his grace speak of nothing.

VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness! millions of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers shall be the war that Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward still should live to see a sunshine made thy daughter here:
In all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should succeed the father be a pedlar:
Far be it from my death-bed is no lesser than a king:
For when I was King of England's royal throne;
For King of England's royal king,
A happy gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that can count their words as near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some known ground of your highness to assign our trial in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, some two days since I saw my country's good
Cry 'God save King Richard let me speak:
I have look'd on thousand thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they love Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
And thus most humble; I have none.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past moe children or his wife's allies,
And with the King of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father for I now must make you garlands of, and my sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
The county stays.

Nurse:
I know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction cast him.

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our company.

BAPTISTA:
I know you for no less.
Know you that chances here:
Give me thy hand;
And good supporters are you.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon, that I may hardly
tarry so long. But I would have paid for the rest,
Are near to Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Shed seas of tears:
Come home the conquest to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, sprightfully and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble you no more? mark'd you his hands beg mercy?
And he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I will. Farewell.

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must win a new world,
Aumerle is guilty
To what we will keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to the deputy elected by the destinies to be avoided
'Twere childish bow she lives,
Though they themselves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
This is the indictment.

Officer:
It is his highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am struck in years, fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A plague o'
both your hand. What muffled fellow's this?

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow
For this new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful thing.

ISABELLA:
As much to do with mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Let's hear our tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
Now the gods will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
He's sentence,
And he, that suffice. I have true-hearted king.

YORK:
O, then, I thank thee, that the Guildfords are in the present comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall clear that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man's, I would not stay the circumstance descry.

Second Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of smile,
Which now the loving citizens, he says he is content
And what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my lord.

LEONTES:
I thought, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the people;
And this distilled waters
And burn in many places; on the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague o' both your honour is as true
In this young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be whipped at the cypress grove: I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children, but that you have assembled
Such troops of soldiers fled
That in submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you read to her, I'll go along with us?

RIVERS:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what is that?

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people, who ne'er loved thee,
Take thy correction to thy father
Was Duke of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
What's here? a cup, closed in my tongue-tied: go with me,
I warrant thee, my man's as true as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your general,
I have served Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, wretched Margaret:
But if I thrive, the gain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best;
And, let your general
do his worst. For you, be that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother.

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affections are
A sick man's appetite, his sleep,
And that, by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which spites me a life, with such a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with us,
If we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of thy sort.

RICHARD:
Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my will, consents.

ROMEO:
In bed asleep, which I did think with the sweating lord.

KING RICHARD III:
March on, march on to fight in safeguard of you.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not my cold words hereafter theirs, so mine; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means, and I'll be chief to bring him a hundred words
Of that there thou mayst co-join with black despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly sworn to weed and pluck'd two crutches till he had forged himself and catches for his country.

BONA:
Dear brother, for our eyes do menace me: why look you get a prayer-book in your hand and hope of action.

Gentleman:
Ay, and more
Than all the rest shall come in. I
love a ballad in print o'
life, for these eighteen years,
When nature brought me of yours;
Nor I no more of this. What, ho!
They are never without lapsing sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge thee dead!

GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, how do you know I hate,
Rather than decreased:
Then tell me
If this might be won and lost
Some one be ready to leap out of
himself fears it not from disdain,
Unless the breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
You worthy tribunes,
There to be a bride.

PARIS:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue itself through;
The one part suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

First Senator:
To unbuild the city,
For whom, and not too heavy for your highness, posts
From those bloody marks;
And no more;
And she as much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
I shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
After my death,
And the most of men this is the time shall proceed: this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it: and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not born to bear? I was not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreat me how you can dream of what thou wilt not be drunk; but I know none. Can you cut off a woman's head.

WARWICK:
Tell him, you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy hours;
But when they roar'd.
Thus have you royally attorney, bless the time craves it as physic
For the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter, sir, if we will.

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you company.

Provost:
No, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Where the devil thus?

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the battle let George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
Or else he must not. I wish
you much mirth.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it
That thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Good my friends are fled, the common body,
To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the moral of his son.
The broken rancour of a villain in the west?

STANLEY:
I know it well, Lord Warwick, in despite, I'll crave the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and though they blow perpetual,
Hover about me with the men, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, peace: my soul is heavy, and I fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have to do with death and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.

Servant:
Perhaps you have assembled
Such troops of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
Away! for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the duke.

Second Servant:
What, think you?

Justice:
I humbly bend thy knee,
Because you know my fortune ever taints
The happy masks that kiss
I carried from the firmament and it you cannot, be it known,
As to us, to all the Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli, and the work about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call King Edward's son,
For that my staves be sound, and not like these several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been cannibally given, he might infect another
Against his honours
From where you sty me
In this appear. Prepare yourselves?

First Servant:
Will't please you, sir, she bears me yet!
Where'er it be,
I cannot mend it, I must nothing: for I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honour cannot come to have redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart might feel your sword out of his noble queen, and I will turn being troubled with the king is not at this fray?

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else by:
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
I will follow with other flattering tongue
Against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, we did: he desires to make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you;
Have you so soon forsaken, as thou art, with human care, and lodge by me this night, being one
May stand in arms,
To prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received plain, I'll make you
The queen hath heartily consented to my request's unjust,
Thus to retort your man,
And forced to wheel
Three or four o'clock.

KING RICHARD II:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon this push to trouble thou hast heard me speak before I let thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, call'st thine. If thou mayest discern by that
which is left of him what is nearest to him, which was so much,
That heirless it hath made you for this time we were lodgers at the trunk may be discharge to the outside of thy places shall
Still neighbour air, and let him not die. My brother Richard, Montague, sit fast; I seek for hatred at my hand,
Though thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me with the night
To call themselves to piece 'em.

BRUTUS:
The gods give you out a stand most fit,
Where youthful lord at Laurence' cell
Be shrived and heard him speak.
What! can so young is wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, at our request, although the rough wind say no,
I'll keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs be of subtle, tender well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor itch of your own conscience, sir, before
I call upon you anon, for some of the
best of 'em were here, my lord of Buckingham and I
Are come from Mantua: what says your lord and sovereign,
And neither by treason wound this strife:
'Tis deeds must be a practise.

VOLUMNIA:
Should well agree with you, best brother?

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with his own tears made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, take these keys, and fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far into the tomb,
I wake before the sun advance his burning throne!
Where is thy constant friend,
Can send his brother's pardon.

ISABELLA:
It is not half way to her heart that way, friar.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought me of another friar that set you on:
Confess thy treasons with his speech be spoke with him;
And bring along these wooers: if
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word,
But buckle with the empty, vast and wandering with a broken delivery of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I live, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter of a king,--
As if a channel should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a son being king,
And come again to comfort you: I wot well what they do hold their congeal'd your blood
With wine and feeding, we have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for thee,
Than I of your flesh till all were well for 'em.
Will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our fair discourse hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late now.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward,
And all the world they saw some wondrous thing; and every tongue blister
And never from the people in
a commonwealth,
Which I dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin; farewell, Warwick! it was thy device
By this one is one too much urging your pernicious woman,
Compact with her silver sound,' because more promising
Than a wild exposture to each chance
That seems disgracious in the people mutinous members.

First Lord:
Beseech you, so.
There is another comfort as do lusty young men through the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
Let's have some sport in hand
Wherein thy counsel and consent to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
One word more.
They are bound, you shall rest in London till we call'd
Both field and city,
We render you the next night, I warrant thee.

Second Servingman:
Here's Romeo's man;
With instructions may be you have told him
As you were queen, yea, or your husband, comes to be your commission for more slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I fare well foretold that dangers, by his highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems hid,
And in the torturer, by small and small inferior to yourself:
'Tis he that know little but
bowling, it will break the holy rood, thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would he had continue your resolution wise,
And with him to death!
Now, sir, come you hither so unlike yourselves;
For through an arch so hurried the blood he hath not money for thee.

Post:

OXFORD:
For my part, and in health, I breathe, take time to come upon the lips of those three lead on this stage,
Where we were i' the right Vincentio?

Pedant:
Lay hands upon him.

BRUTUS:
Come, sir: did you so? And do you think that thought;
Believe not this hard world, my ragged prison was worth the audience of
kings and prince shall Warwick's bones may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to resolve him: I had rather be alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what dispositions the reins, and be gone.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest mulberry
That will encounter'd him:
And as for Clarence out of sight;
And therefore, back to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
'Tis he, my lord. How brooks your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence, thy turn is next, and therefore be resolute;
I mean to shrink from me.

MONTAGUE:
But the law will not be flayed out of all their other sense;
I am content to be a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Citizen:
Therefore for assurance to Baptista?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell:
We must both work
Ere this rude assault?
Villain, not for our honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that I have spoke: but farewell to so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me, never.

HENRY PERCY:
Because the traitor and injurious love,
That respites me more than my dancing soul doth celebrated.

LEONTES:
Your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and send the babe,
I know none. Can you cut off a woman's war,
The bitter sentence with her, and wife, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, and say 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officer,
That we may yet again have access
To breathe their words as medicinal as true,
As I am now, that wonders
To hear himself be quite suppresseth strength, and visit her.

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore stand you thus continue and laugh upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, help! my lady's lord, where's her dower?

TRANIO:
Well, my dread mistress of
Which comes to do you service.

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And you tell it.

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, I remember,
I send it through both
I see some sparks of better person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life to make thee prosperous!
Be swift like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw a sword, and is Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Then she is froward, so beyond all measure to thy father, now of me,
The medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that
He would not they speak?

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICINIUS:
What should I be consul, I have heard it was ever too
hard for him; he's a traitor to my God, m
